The idea about a museum collection was born even before, back in 1825, when it was first mentioned on the pages of the literary magazine \"Annals of Matica Srpska\". This idea came into reality on October 14, 1847, when a decision was made to found the Serbian National Collection or the Museum, saying “it will be the venue, where all the antiques and valuables will be kept”.\r\nThe first museum collection stems from Sava Tekelija’s rich legacy. Following a multi- decade long committed work, this collection had grown to become the Museum of Matica Srpska, and as such, it was opened on July 9, 1933. in Novi Sad, where Matica Srpska had been moved from Budapest in 1864.\r\nOn 30th May 1947, with the goal to establish a central museum covering the entire territory of Vojvodina, a section was taken out of the material kept at Matica Srpska Museum, and that is how the Vojvodina Museum was founded as a complex museum with several collections covering archaeology, ethnology, history, history of art, zoology, botanics, geology-palaeonthology and minerology-pethrography. At the same time, the Museum was assigned to do professional supervision over all museums in the Province. \r\nSubsequently several further institutions emerged from the Vojvodina Museum and one of them was the Museum of the Working-Class Movement and the National Revolution, founded in 1956.\r\nThis museum and the Archives of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of Serbia for Vojvodina were integrated in 1971. and became the Museum of Socialist Revolution - later the Historical Museum of Vojvodina.\r\nFinally, on May 20th 1992, the Vojvodina Museum joined the Vojvodina Historical Museum to become the Museum of Vojvodina.\r\n","buildings":"After three decades of temporary residing in different locations, in 1974. the Vojvodina Museum moved into the current building, in which the court had once operated. The building was erected back in 1896, after the design of Gyula Wagner, an architect from Budapest.\r\nNext to this main building, there is another one that houses Museum of Vojvodina - former Museum of Socialist Revolution building that was constructed specially for that purpose, designed by architect Ivo Vitić in 1959. and built in 1965. Today it is the building where the Section of Recent History (20th Century) of Museum of Vojvodina is placed, along with the Museum of Contemporary Art of Vojvodina.\r\nThe museum network also incorporates the following annexes: “Brvnara”- log cabin ethnic-house in Bački Jarak and the Museum Complex in Kulpin, as part of the Museum since 2004.\r\n","holdings":"The Museum of Vojvodina is a reference centre for all the institutions dealing with movable cultural property, such as museums, galleries and art collections in the territory of Vojvodina.\r\nWith its remarkable variety of departments, the Museum houses a rich collection of about 400,000 objects and a library with over 50,000 publications. The scientifically complex permanent exhibition presents the development of the human kind in the present territory of Vojvodina, covering the span of eight thousand years. On 3,000 square meters 6,000 objects represent archaeology, general history, arts history and ethnology. The permanent exhibition gives a synthesis of the region’s several millennia long history.\r\nFor the Holocaust studies, the most significant Museum's holdings are placed within the collections of the Section of Recent History, situated in 37 Dunavska street (former Museum of Socialist Revolution). Most relevant on this topic are the collections of documents, photos and posters. The library containing relevant publications is also at researchers’ disposal.\r\n","openingTimes":"The Museum exhibitions: Tuesday – Friday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Saturday – Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Working with researchers: Monday – Friday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. (excluding public holidays)\r\n","conditions":"Before starting a research, it is necessary to contact one of the curators of the Archive Collection (kristina.menesi@muzejvojvodine.org.rs or ivana.kulacin@muzejvojvodine.org.rs) and fill in a form, in order to access museum holdings.","accessibility":"The Museum of Vojvodina is located in two buildings in the central zone of Novi Sad.

He wanted the documents to create the basis for further research with new questions in the context of an academic institute; he wanted the spirit of his work to be maintained at a time when both the perpetrators and the victims of the Nazi era will have died. In the year 2000, at a time when Simon Wiesenthal was still alive, several renowned Viennese academic institutions and the Jewish Community Vienna (IKG) initiated the establishment of an international centre for research on the Holocaust. Simon Wiesenthal still had the opportunity to personally contribute to the design of the resulting \"Vienna Wiesenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies\" before his death in September 2005. It was the aim that the institute should, in accordance with the spirit of his life's work, be dedicated to the research, documentation and education on all issues related to antisemitism, racism and the Holocaust, remaining, most of all, open to new and innovative trends in the relevant research areas. The decision that the Republic of Austria and the City of Vienna would finance the three year foundation phase of the institue on the basis of a detailled plan of working stages together with the Jewish Community (IKG), resp. the supporting organization of the Simon Wiesenthal archive, the \"Bund jüdischer Verfolgter des Naziregimes\" [\"Association of Jews Persecuted by the Nazi Regime\"], was eventually reached in 2008.The Vienna Wiesenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies (VWI) is active in three central fields: documentation, research (fellowship programme), and education.","holdings":"Documentation centres around its centrepieces, the Holocaust-related parts of the IKG archive, which are on loan to the institute, and the estate of Simon Wiesenthal with its extensive holdings on Nazi perpetrators, as well as the VWI library. On the basis of this collection, which are either owned by or accessible via the institute, the VWI will conduct its research activities in the form of projects and the initiation of publications. \r\n\r\n**Simon Wiesenthal Archive:**\r\nIn the early 1960s, when the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jews Persecuted by the Nazi Regime (Dokumentationszentrums des Bundes Jüdischer Verfolgter des Naziregimes) was established in Vienna, Simon Wiesenthal opened a Vienna office where he worked intensively on research related to the Nazi era. Here, he collected many documents on Nazi perpetrators and Nazi crimes (around 8000 files) over the course of many years. However, his life and work was particularly marked by his concern with society's attitudes towards the past and his resultant engagement against forgetting. The archive also contains the extensive correspondence that emerged from his work. Before he died, Simon Wiesenthal expressed his wish that the entire collection of materials would be integrated in the Vienna Wiesenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies (VWI), which was then still in its initial planning stages. In order to realize this intention, the archive holdings are successively being entered into a database and made accessible to the public for research purposes.\r\n\r\n**The archive of the Jewish Community Vienna (Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien, IKG):** \r\nThe archive was officially established in 1816, when the representatives of the Jewish community decided to collect and keep safely all patents, decrees and ordinances of the Jews of Vienna. The documents were organized by name and keyword until into the 1920s. The IKG Vienna was forced to dissolve the archive immediately upon the„annexation“of Austria by Hitler Germany in March 1938. In addition, the SS confiscated large parts of the archive, including documents of Jewish associations and organizations, and brought them to Berlin in 1938/1939. These documents were later transported to Silesia, where they were discovered by the Red Army at the end of the war and transported to Moscow as“Beutedokumente”. The archive was at first not reestablished after the liberation in 1945. The newly constituted IKG Vienna, which was not comparable with the pre-1938 community either in number or membership, had grave doubts that there would ever be such a flowering Jewish community as there had been before the \"annexation\". This is why the IKG Vienna gave a large part of its archives on loan to the \"Central Archives\" in Jerusalem in the beginning of the 1950s as well as in the 1960s and 1970s. In the year 2000, the \"presumably lost archive\", which had already been discovered once before in 1986 in the synagogue basement, was found again. It makes up the basis for the reconstruction of the overall Vienna archive. Until the end of 2008, the archive was part of the former Contact Point for Jewish Victims of National-Socialist Persecution in and from Austria (Anlaufstelle der IKG Wien für jüdische NS-Verfolgte in und ausÖsterreich). \r\nIn January 2009, the IKG Vienna archive was reestablished as a department, thus consciously underlining the archive's unique nature. Today, the archive is the largest preserved archive of any Jewish community. It comprises numerous sources on Shoah research and on the history and development of the Jewish community in Vienna and its members reaching as far back as the 17th century. Parts of the archive are still located in Jerusalem, Moscow and other places. However, the complete collection is to be reunited in its original location of Vienna. Further information on the collection can be found on the [website of the Archive of the Jewish Community Vienna]( http://www.archiv-ikg-wien.at/) and in the respective [entry in the EHRI Portal](https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/at-001985).\r\n\r\n**Austrian Heritage Archive (AHA)**: Austrian Heritage Archive is a project led by the Verein GEDENKDIENST and the Vienna Wiensenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies (VWI) in cooperation with the Leo Baeck Institute New York, the Leo Baeck Institute Jerusalem and the Centre for Jewish Cultural History (ZJK) at the University of Salzburg. The Austrian Heritage Archive collects video and audio interviews with Jewish Austrian emigrés who fled to the USA or Palestine/Israel during the National Socialist period or immediately afterwards. The interviews are presented in their edited form and are accompanied by biographical documents and materials. In this way, the Austrian Heritage Archive is able to offer a resource to academics and anybody else with an interest in history to look in more depth at the life stories of the people featured. The interviews were conducted by young Austrians over the past 25 years and collected and archived in the Leo Baeck Institute New York and the Leo Baeck Institute Jerusalem as part of the Austrian Heritage Collection. Further information is available on the [website of the Austrian Heritage Archive](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwii0YOEtqCCAxVOYPEDHcZDB-4QFnoECA4QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Faustrianheritagearchive.at%2Fde%2Fcontent%2Faha&usg=AOvVaw1b7eJONdJhkLyqtScJU-1Q&opi=89978449). \r\n\r\n**The Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies**: The Fortunoff Video Archive comprises more than 12,000 hours of video interviews with Holocaust survivors. For a long time, these recordings could only be viewed on site at Yale University. In the framework of an agreement concluded between Yale University and the Vienna Wiesenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies (VWI) in January 2017 the interviews can now – following registration and ordering of materials – also be viewed at the VWI. The archive emerged from the collection of 183 interviews created in 1979 as part of the Holocaust Survivors Film Project and today comprises more than 4,400 interviews in 22 languages that were either recorded at Yale University or in the framework of partner projects. The individual recordings can be browsed via the online catalogue.

Nevertheless it took another thirty years for it to become an institutional archive. From the 1840ies onwards most records have been kept continuously, pointing out institutional concerns of a religious community with increasing educational and social functions. \r\nDuring the 19th century the Archive was professionally organized and until the 1920ies the records were catalogued by subject terms and individual names. \r\n\r\nImmediately after the so called “Anschluss” in March 1938 the IKG was temporarily closed by the Nazis. In the beginning of May 1938 the IKG was reopened and the Nazis forced the IKG to abandon its Archive. The indexes and files that had been produced before and after 1938 were the basis for the Nazi to force the IKG to organise Jewish emigration and later on deportation.\r\n\r\nAfter the end of the Nazi terror regime in May 1945 the newly established Jewish Community had become very small due to the Nazi persecution. About 120,000 Austrian Jews fled the “Reich” and 65,000 Jews had been murdered by the Nazis, among them 48,000 Jews that had been deported to concentration camps. \r\n\r\nBy decision of the Board of the Jewish Community of Vienna the Archive was re-founded and re-opened in 2009.\r\n","mandates":"Archive of the Jewish Community of Vienna\r\n","administrativeStructure":"The Jewish Community (IKG) of Vienna is a corporation under public law. It represents the cultural, social, religious and educational interests of its approximately 8,900 members. \r\nIn 2009, 70 years after its closure by the Nazis, the Archive was founded and embedded as department in the organisational structure of the IKG Vienna. \r\nDue to further reorganization in 2013/2014 the Jewish Records Office (Matrikenamt) was connected to the Archive. It preserves birth, marriage and death records of the Jewish population of Vienna from 1826 until 1938.","holdings":"THE HOLDINGS OF THE ARCHIVE OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY OF VIENNA\r\n\r\nThe records in Vienna and those deposited in Israel as a loan represent the largest preserved archive of a Jewish Community still in existence.  \r\n\r\nArchival Material in Jerusalem on loan: Due to the tremendous challenges the IKG had to face after World War II the Archive could not be reopened and the chairmanship of the IKG finally agreed to the transfer of archival records to Jerusalem as a loan and free of charge. In 1952, 1966, 1971 and 1978 two thirds of the archival material of the period from 1626 to 1945 had been transferred to the “The Jewish Historical General Archives” (now: The Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People in Jerusalem).  \r\nThe transferred material consists of about 3 million pages, numerous documents from the 19th and early 20th century dealing with internal and external affairs in the areas of general administration, finance, construction, registration, cemeteries, social welfare, religious and teaching affairs as well as institutional concerns and daily activities of a religious community. The archival material in Jerusalem also contains numerous documents concerning expulsion, emigration and deportation of the Jewish population during the Nazi terror regime. \r\n\r\nArchival Material in Vienna: For more than two decades it was assumed that the entire archival records had been deposited at the Central Archives in Jerusalem as a loan. But the IKG authorities seemed to have overlooked numerous records, indices and books relating to the periods before, during and after the National Socialist era. In 1986 innumerable records were found by Mr. Ernst Meir Stern during the renovation of the cellar of the main synagogue. How and why these records were kept in Vienna remains unknown. The entire archival holdings were brought to a storage place where they fell again into oblivion. \r\nThe former President of the IKG, Mr. Ariel Muzicant, and the Executive Director of the presidency of the IKG, Ms. Erika Jakubovits, could not accept this situation and consistently investigated the allegedly missing Archive. In 2000 they found 800 cardboard boxes, index cards, documents and large books reaching from the floor to the ceiling in a storage room at Herklotzgasse in the 15th district of Vienna. The archival holdings were transported to the Jewish Community of Vienna. \r\nThe majority of the re-found documents were identified as dating from the Nazi era such as the emigration card index, deportation lists, reports, emigration and financial documents, books, maps and charts. They were mixed with more recent as well as older material from the 19th and early 20th centuries. \r\nWith the financial support of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum the IKG was able to start the microfilming of Holocaust-related records in Vienna and Jerusalem in 2002/2003. More than three and a half million pages have been microfilmed since then.","openingTimes":"If you wish to visit the Archive/Jewish Records Office it is necessary due to organisational reasons to make an appointment by email at least one week before your planned visit. \r\n","accessibility":"The Archive is located in the first Viennese district, Desider-Friedmann-Platz 1, first floor.

Karamanlis’ Foundation, established in 1983, an important centre for the preservation of historical memory and facilitation of scientific research, is the outcome of private initiative. Three eminent personalities of the world of letters, well aware of the conjunction of circumstances, Konstantinos Tsatsos, Κonstantinos Τrypanis and Konstantinos Svolopoulos, incited by the establishment of such foundations in the broader international sphere, addressed a letter to Konstantinos Karamanlis on 14 May 1983, in which among other issues the following was stressed: “every citizen, and the prominent especially, have the duty to care for preserving in the memory of those to come after them, the political events constituting the history of their era… Motivated by the above sentiments, we have decided on an initiative with the objective of conservation of written texts and oral testimonies of the historical period of our lifetime, which coincides with the period during which you yourself played a leading role in Greece’s political life…”\r\n \r\nKonstantinos Karamanlis responded positively to the proposal and proceeded to the establishment of the Foundation, in the conviction that “History must not be forgotten” and that “the teachings of history are always opportune”.\r\nHis decision to entrust his political archive to a non-profit Foundation to bear his name, was a pioneering act and contributed decisively to a scholarly approach of essence toward the problems of contemporary Greek history. His example was subsequently followed by other Greek politicians, and the foundations established with similar characteristics are evidence of Karamanlis’ timely response to the general spirit reigning at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Foundation’s primary goal is as comprehensively as possible to cast light on the historical events of the period after World War II, in conjunction with systematic study and research of what was accomplished by Konstantinos Karamanlis, and the promotion of the idea of a unified Europe. A fundamental prerequisite for attaining this goal was the collection, conservation and valorization of his personal archive, aspiring to the promotion of scientific research unconnected to any political or other expediency.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is a legal entity under private law subject to the legislation regarding non-profitable foundations. Its establishment and operation is exclusively dependent on the financial support of private individuals, Karamanlis’ close relatives and friends. \r\n","buildings":"The building housing the Foundation in Philothei, designed by the architect Iason Rizos, stands on wholly privately owned land, donated by Konstantinos Karamanlis himself at the same time as his personal archive. Building work was completed in October 1987 and there ensued the installation, equipment, the supplementation and systematic organization of the archive and the library, with the contribution and precious assistance of close friends of the President – primarily of his brother Grammenos G. Karamanlis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to his own wish, Konstantinos Karamanlis was interred in the grounds of the Foundation on 24 April 1998.","holdings":"The institution holds primary sources illuminating the political history of Greece.\r\n \r\nThe Konstantinos Karamanlis archive, donated by himself, constitutes the main core of this material, covering the broader span of his political career from 1935 to 1998, the year of his death. \r\n \r\nThe Historical Archive has moreover been complemented with the archives of prominent political personalities and Karamanlis’ close collaborators. The Foundation already contains the archives of Panagis Tsaldaris, Konstantinos Tsaldaris, Evangelos Averoff-Tositsas, Konstantinos Papakonstantinos,, Lina Tsaldari, Alkis Delmouzos  and other personalities. A valuable acquisition was Anastasios Kanellopoulos’ archive referring to Panagiotis Kanellopoulos. There are also files of useful data in respect of specific thematic entities, from eponymous donors.\r\n\r\nPanagis (1868 - 1936) and his nephew, Konstantinos (1884-1970) Tsaldaris were leaders of the Populist Party and leading political figures in interwar and post-war Greece. Asher Moissis, a prominent Jewish lawyer who lived in Thessaloniki, was connected with Tsaldaris’ political party, for whom he had been a candidate in the 1936 elections. In the face of the Jewish deportations in March 1943, Moissis seemed to mobilize his connections with Tsaldaris family, to organize letters of protest to the Greek and German authorities in Athens.\r\nPanagis, Konstantinos and Lina’s Tsaldari archives are thus considered of possible interest for the study of Holocaust in Greece.\r\n","conditions":"The Foundation has drawn up special regulations for the accessibility of archival material to students and researchers.

This initiative answered the need to promote the study of history by using primary sources and material.\r\n\r\nThe Research Centre for Macedonian History and Documentation (KEMIT) features a specialised library and electronic databases, collects and processes archival material, publishes monographs and studies, organises seminars and conferences, provides information and documentation to interested parties and generally promotes the academic objectives of the Foundation through all possible means.","buildings":"The building that houses the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle has its own story to tell. During Byzantine times, a monastery most probably stood on the site of the cathedral-complex, dedicated to an unidentified saint. After the fall of Thessaloniki, a plot of land was given to the Christians, near the coastal walls, to build their church. In 1870, with the demolition of the coastal walls of Thessaloniki, the vertical road that is the current street of Agia Sofia was opened, while at the same time the current street of Proxenou Koromila was formed, with the alignment of the road parallel to the waterfront. In this way, the corner of Agia Sofia and Proxenou Koromila streets was formed, on which the Greek community built in 1881, on a plot that belonged to the Diocese and with the financial sponsorship of Dimitrios Philippovich, curator and treasurer of the community delegation, the first building that will house the Greek Consulate in Thessaloniki, which then belonged to the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe fire of 1890 caused severe damage to the historical centre of the city. The building of the current museum, which was rebuilt in 1893 to house the Consulate General of Greece in Thessaloniki until 1912, also sustained severe damage. Soon, with the insurance money, the donation by Andreas Syngros and the help offered by the Greek government, a sufficient amount was collected to reconstruct the buildings of the Greek community. Among them was a new church and beside it a magnificent neoclassical residence was built to plans of the German architect Ernst Ziller, appropriate for a consular manor. The foundations of the Consulate were laid in September 1892 on the site of the ruined building and work was completed in August 1893, with a total cost of 2,000 Turkish lires. In 1894, it was rented by the city’s Greek community to the Hellenic state to house the Greek Consulate in Thessaloniki.  The first Greek General Consul to occupy it was Georgios Dokos, who had supervised the works.\r\nThe term of office of Consul General Lambros Koromilas (1904-1907) was of major importance because he organised all the secret services for the Macedonian Struggle in Macedonia, in order to act effectively, almost under a single administration.  A select group of officers, appointed as “special clerks”, served as staff officers from the consular building (known as “the Centre”). They were essentially the ones who received the various reports that came in, assessed the situation, gave orders, met with various clerical figures and teachers. The Consulate building frequently hosted fighters who entered unnoticed through a side door into the courtyard of the neighboring episcopal residence.\r\nAfter the accession of Macedonia accession to the Greek state, the consular service was dissolved. The building then housed the Agricultural Bank of Greece in 1915 and in 1917 and for the next three years, it housed the National Bank of Greece, and in 1923 it housed the 21st Elementary School of Thessaloniki During the German Occupation, the building was used by the International Red Cross to run a soup kitchen, while at the end of the Civil War and for a few months, the basement served to hold political prisoners. Over the following decades it housed the Girls School and from 1970 to 1982 the 43rd Primary School. Since 1982 this historical building houses the Museum for the Macedonian Struggle.\r\n","holdings":"KEMIT does not only hold collections of Greek archives, but also foreign archival material divided in 3 main categories:\r\n- Archives from the period 1870-1925, containing collections of the  US National Archives, which contain correspondence from the American Consulate in Thessaloniki (1870-1912); Collections from the Quai d’Orsay (1871-1895, 1896-1910);Collections from the UK Public Record Office, which contain correspondence from the British Consulate (1879-1911);Collections from the Imperial and Royal Austro-Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and from many Austro-Hungarian Consulates of the Ottoman Empire (Bitola, Thessaloniki, Adrianople, Istanbul);Collections from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Correspondence with the Russian Consulate of Thessaloniki);Collections from the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Correspondence from the Consulates of Thessaloniki and Bitola).\r\n\r\n- Documents belonging to local Macedonian chief captains.\r\n\r\n- Archival material from the 1930-1983 period.\r\n\r\nKEMIT also holds a digital database containing  information about the demographics in Macedonia  and a large collection of digitised photographs of Macedonia (late 19th – 20th century).

During the late 19th century, the dispute between the European powers over the fate of the Ottoman Empire became clearer. Introverted rebellions were often noted, with the aim of uniting Crete with the Greek state. As a consequence of the above, the Jews of Crete began to emigrate, ending up in 1941 with only one community surviving - that of Chania - numbering approximately 330 people. This community had two synagogues dating back to the Middle Ages – Beth Shalom and Kal Kantos Etz Hayim.\r\n\r\n \r\nIn 1941, during the bombing of Chania at the beginning of the Battle of Crete, Beth Shalom was destroyed, leaving only one synagogue to serve the needs of the community. In May 1944 the entire community was arrested by the Nazis and, after a period of detention in nearby prisons, was sent to Heraklion, where they were put on the ship Tanais. In the early hours of the next day, in the middle of sailing to the port of Piraeus, the ship was torpedoed by a British submarine and sank within 15 minutes. There were no survivors.\r\n","buildings":"The building dates to the 14th-15th centuries and was originally a Venetian Catholic church, the Church of St. Katherine, located in the heart of the small, centuries-old Jewish neighbourhood, Evraiki, situated behind the harbour-front along Kondylaki, Skoufon, Zambeliou and Portou Streets. The church was damaged in the 1540s during one of the Ottoman Turkish attacks on the city led by the Chief Admiral of the Ottoman fleet, Khair ad-Din Kapdian Pasha, otherwise known as Barbarossa. In the mid- to late 17th century, after the eventual Ottoman conquest of Crete (1669), the building was acquired by Hania’s Jewish community who then converted it into a synagogue. Prior to the Second World War, Kal Kadosh Etz Hayyim, a Romaniote synagogue, together with Beth Shalom (bombed in 1941), a Sephardic synagogue, served the needs of Hania’s Jewish community. Once this community was deported in 1944, Etz Hayyim was looted and desecrated and then occupied by squatters until the mid-1950s. From that time until the mid-1990s, the derelict synagogue served as a repository of neighbourhood rubbish, and invariably as a chicken pen, dog kennel and storeroom.\r\n \r\n\r\nHaving stood abandoned for almost 50 years following the end of the Second World War, the fortunes of Etz Hayyim were about to change as a result of the intervention by Hania resident, Nikos Stavroulakis (himself an artist, writer, academic and founding director of the Jewish Museums of of Athens and Thessaloniki) who wanted to rebuild and revive the synagogue after surveying extensive earthquake damage caused to the building in 1995. Soon afterwards, Nikos gave a lecture about Etz Hayyim at a symposium jointly sponsored by the World Monuments Fund and the Jewish Heritage Program in New York. As a result, Etz Hayyim was added to the prestigious list of the world’s “100 Most Endangered Sites” of international cultural concern compiled by the World Monuments Fund in 1996. With this recognition, Nikos acquired the funding to fully restore the synagogue, a process which took three years and was headed by Nikos himself under the aegis of the World Monuments Fund in cooperation with the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece (KISE). Funding was provided by the Rothschild, Lauder, Rosenberg, Rose and other foundations and donations from interested individuals. The synagogue was officially rededicated on 10 October,1999 with Rabbis Jacob Arar and Isaak Mizan of Athens as the celebrants assisted by Rabbi Yacob Dayan of Salonika. Approximately 350 people were present including members of the various Greek Jewish communities, representatives from the Orthodox and Catholic churches in Hania and local and international dignitaries such as the Hon. Constantine Mitsotakis, the former Prime Minister and President of the New Democracy Party of Greece alongside the German Ambassador to Greece.\r\n \r\n\r\nSince 2010, Etz Hayyim has been operated by a non-profit organisation in cooperation with the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece (KISE). This non-profit organisation is registered as a charity in Greece and, because Etz Hayyim does not receive any public funding, it raises funds for the maintenance of the synagogue and for the various religious and cultural events to ensure its long-term preservation. Two decades after its rededication, Etz Hayyim has become a fixture in the religious and socio-cultural life of Hania as a place of prayer, study, recollection and reconciliation. It is an active, non-denominational synagogue used for celebrating various Jewish holidays and non-religious cultural events including lectures, concerts and exhibitions. Its small team of staff and volunteers undertake ongoing research into the history of Cretan Jews at the same time as engaging both local and international school groups and teachers as part of the synagogue’s educational outreach program. The synagogue today welcomes Jews of all different backgrounds, as well as non-Jews and as such, Etz Hayyim stands as perhaps the only active reminder of the once multifaith, multicultural society of Hania and Crete.\r\n","holdings":"Etz Hayyim serves as a research and resource centre. At Etz Hayyim, we conduct ongoing research into the history of Cretan Jewish communities at our library, the Evlagon Institute for Cretan Jewish Studies, named after the last chief Rabbi of Crete, Avraham Evlagon (1846-1933). The Institute coordinates research projects, publishes research results and develops materials for the synagogue’s educational outreach program and exhibitions.\r\n\r\nEtz Hayyim’s library evolved from the personal reference collection of Nikos Stavroulakis, the founding Director of Etz Hayyim Synagogue. In its original form, his collection comprised books, off-prints of articles and monographs concerning the Jews in the western Ottoman Empire, both Romaniote or Sephardi. . The collection also includes monographs on general Jewish history and volumes on related subjects such as theology, mysticism, and political identity. There are also some 250 CDs of music, liturgical and secular, of the Romaniote and Sephardi traditions.\r\n \r\nIn 2000, Nikos’ personal reference collection was relocated to the synagogue where it could be properly catalogued and added to with funding provided by private donors. Unfortunately, a considerable number of these books and monographs were destroyed or rendered unusable due to the two arson attacks in 2010 during which the synagogue’s archive containing documentation of the mid- to late 1990s renovation along with original records of the pre-1944 Jewish community were destroyed. Etz Hayyim was then offered the current library premises by the Archaeological Authority in Hania through the assistance of its then-Director, Michael Andreanakis, and numerous damaged books were restored by specialised staff.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of the two arson attacks, Etz Hayyim received an overwhelming response from all over the world to support the restoration of the library and its works. There were donations of Sephardi prayer books and newly-made liturgical texts from Israel and New York. The Yiddish Book Centre in New York also circulated our list of lost and damaged books and, as a result, Etz Hayyim was donated numerous books from across the US. We were particularly fortunate to receive more than 800 works from Mrs Judy Hetzler Humphrey of Manassa, Virginia. Those books not only replaced the ones we had lost, but expanded our library in other directions, for example, Africa and African Art.\r\n","openingTimes":"Monday to Thursday:10 am- 4 pm\r\n\r\nFriday: 10 am- 3 pm\r\n\r\nClosed on weekends and Greek public holidays"},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"gr","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/gr-006599","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/gr-006599/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/gr"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2023-10-18T11:00:05.649Z"}},{"id":"gr-006598","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Εβραϊκή Κοινότητα Ρόδου - Εβραϊκό Μουσείο Ρόδου","parallelFormsOfName":["Jewish Community of Rhodes - Jewish Museum of Rhodes"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Dossiadou and Simiou Streets (Old City)","city":"Rhodes (Old City)","region":"South Aegean","postalCode":" 851 00","country":"Greece","countryCode":"GR","email":["jcrhodes@otenet.gr"],"telephone":["+302241022364","+302241073039"],"fax":[],"url":["https://jewishrhodes.org/"]},"history":"The Museum was established in October 1997, in the first two rooms of the former women’s prayer rooms of the Kahal Shalom Synagogue.\r\nFounder of the Museum is Aron Hasson, a lawyer and a third generation Rhodian from Los Angeles who noticed the lack of awareness about the unique history of the Jewish community of Rhodes.\r\nIt started as an exhibition of photographic material that was collected from Rhodian Jews of Diaspora, documenting prewar Jewish life on Rhodes.\r\nGradually, with the motivation and the economic contribution of the Community and individual donors, the Museum expanded to all the rooms of the ex-women’s section.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince June 2002 with the cooperation of the Jewish Museum of Greece, a permanent panel exhibition was put on display.

The museum and the synagogue are being visited by more than 20,000 visitors every year.\r\n","generalContext":"**Historical Background**\r\n\r\nThe settlement of Jews in Rhodes is mentioned for the first time in the Book of Maccabees and it dates back to the 2nd century B.C. Proof of the Jewish presence in Rhodes has remained immutable for many centuries. The narrow, arched, paved medieval alleys of the “Juderia” (Jewish) quarter bear until today Jewish symbols. The historian Josephus also mentions the Jews of the island in the 1st century A.D. Later historic texts confirm their presence during the 12th century. In 1116, the Spanish traveller Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela visited the island and wrote in his “Itinerary” that he found 400 to 500 Jews living there. This number increased significantly when, in 1280, Jews from Aragon joined them.\r\n\r\nAn Italian Rabbi traveller, who visited Rhodes in 1467, quoted in his letter still preserved in Florence: “I have never encountered a Jewish Community in which everyone, from the eldest to the youngest, is so intelligent they have long hair and look like princes. The Knights of Hospitalers of Rhodes visit the Jewish homes regularly in order to admire the beautiful embroideries.”\r\n\r\nThe Jews of Rhodes were also known to have been ardent defenders of the city against the Turks in 1480. After the Turkish attack against the island, only 22 Jewish families survived. In spite of their fear of Turkish attacks, they managed to stand strong and continue with their lives. In the 16th century many Jews were expelled from Rhodes after a resolution passed by the Council of the Knights. A little later new Jewish families arrived from Thessaloniki, and as a result, Rhodes became a significant Sephardic center. Thanks to the establishment of many Synagogues and Rabbinical Schools and to the flourishing commerce during the four centuries that followed, the Jewish Community gained a special position. Wealthy textile and silk merchants co-existed with gunsmiths, craftsmen, bookbinders and weavers.\r\n\r\nAs of 1888 the educational program of the Alliance Israelite Universelle School began to operate thanks to the donations of Edmond Rothchild. The boys and the girls school started functioning in 1901 and 1902. The school was destroyed in the bombings of 1943.\r\n\r\nThe Jews of Rhodes lived in two quarters, had two Synagogues and the travelers who were visiting the island talked about their piousness and their concern with theological issues.\r\n\r\nIn 1941 there were about 1,800 Jews living in Rhodes. They had four Synagogues. The “Shalom” Synagogue, on the junction of Dosiadou and Simiou Streets, as well as the ancient Jewish cemetery, survived World War II. The Synagogue was originally built in the 12th century, was destroyed during the war between the Turks and the Knights and was rebuilt in the end of the 15th century.\r\n\r\n**Holocaust**\r\n\r\nFrom September 1943 until July 1944, while the Germans were arresting and displacing Jews all over Greece, no measures were taken against the Jews living in Rhodes. This eased their initial fears and gave to the members of the Jewish Community the false impression of peace and hope that nothing serious was going to occur. Only a few young Jews, risking their lives, dared to escape in shaky boats to the Turkish coasts. The rest waited and hoped.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Nazis were preparing their criminal plan for the displacement and the elimination of the Jews. In mid-July 1944, the German Command ordered the Jews to reside solely within the confines of the city of Rhodes or in the villages of Trianta, Kremasti and Villanova (now known as Paradisi). These were the places were they had fled in order to escape the bombardments, in a distance no more than twelve kilometers from the city.\r\n\r\nA few days later, on 18 July 1944, a German officer turned up at the house of the president of the Jewish Community and told him that, according to the orders of the German Commander, all Jewish men over 16 had to appear the following morning in the old headquarters of the Italian Air Force. They had to bring with them their identity cards and their work permits. This trick made everyone believe that they would be gathered in order to be sent to forced labour.\r\n\r\nIn the next morning, two SS officers, who were sent from the “Rosenberg Command” in Athens, walked into the room accompanied by an interpreter. With brutality and threatening, they grabbed the documents from the hands of the Jews gathered in the room. They assigned the president of the Community the task to inform the women to join their husbands within 24 hours, otherwise they would be shot. They also had to carry with them all their belongings: jewelry, gold sovereigns, banknotes, a few personal items and food.\r\n\r\nIn the confusion that ensued, and in their ignorance, the women could do nothing but to obey the order. On 20 July, almost all the Jews of Rhodes had been captured and were held in this improvised concentration camp. The Germans started, with immense brutality, taking everything valuable from them. In the meantime, the Germans were plundering the houses of the Jews that had been hastily deserted. The Italian High Command was forced to issue an order according to which all Jewish real estate and assets were confiscated in favour of the Italian State.\r\n\r\nAt this point one should mention the humanitarian stance shown by the Turkish consul, Selahettin Ulkumen, who intervened to save not only Turkish nationals but whole families as well, even at the remotest proof of their Turkish citizenship. He managed to save from the Nazis approximately 40 Jews who would have otherwise been led to death. For his acts, he was awarded after the War the title of “Righteous among the Nations” by Yad Vashem.\r\n\r\nThe order for the departure came at noon of Sunday 23 July. An endless queue of Jews set off. They were more than 1,600 men, women, children and elderly. Some were dragging their sad belongings, others were carrying them on their backs. Some were not walking fast enough. The guards, who were following the file accompanied by wild Alsatians, were beating them with their rifle stocks. Heads down, they passed through the city. The streets were empty as the Germans had sounded the alarm for air attacks. Once they arrived at the port, they were thrown in three very old cargo vessels. The presence of Jews on the island, which dated many centuries back, ended on that sad day of the summer of 1944.\r\n\r\nThe course from Rhodes to the port of Piraeus was horrible. It was terribly hot and the vessels were so full that those in the cargo hauls could not go up even to get some air. Seven persons died in the course of the voyage and their bodies were thrown in the sea.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at the port of Piraeus on 31 July 1944 and were immediately taken to Haidari, where they were ruthlessly humiliated. The Red Cross was not allowed to give them food and water until 36 hours after their arrival. The women were separated from the men. They were stripped in the most barbaric way to make sure that they had no more jewelry on them.\r\n\r\nThe Germans in an apparent attempt to break their morale were beating men, women and children sometimes to death. During the three days of their stay in the Haidari camp, another ten of the Jews of Rhodes died.\r\n\r\nOn 3 August, after having extracted their gold teeth and glasses, the Germans led the Jews in animal wagons. They put 65 persons in each wagon and sealed the doors. That was the last “consignment” of Jews from Greece. The trip to Poland lasted 13 days. About 100 people died during the trip and their bodies were thrown in the fields along the rail lines. They arrived in Auschwitz on 16 August and, after the horrible “selection” procedure, 1,200 persons, those who were judged too weak to work, were immediately sent to the gas chambers and the crematoria. The remainder was sent to forced labour in quarries, in coal mines and in the railways. The women were raped, sterilized and used in inhuman experiments, with no mercy.\r\n\r\nDespite their short stay in the camp, most died of hardships, weakness and diseases. Only 150 survived: 120 women and 30 men. It is worth mentioning though that even after their liberation by the Allied forces, many of them died of exhaustion as they had become living skeletons.\r\n\r\n**Post-War Period**\r\n\r\nBefore the War, the Jewish Communities of Rhodes and Kos numbered 1,900 members. After the liberation their total population was not more than 200 persons.\r\n\r\nOn August 6th, 1946, Gabriel Charitos is elected First Mayor of a free Rhodes, after 600 years of occupation.\r\n\r\nIn memory of his fellow Rhodians, the members of the Jewish Community, he names the central square of “La Juderia” to “Square of Jewish Martyrs”, the unanimous resolution of the then City Council of Rhodes, being the first official recognition of the Holocaust on behalf of a Greek authority.\r\n\r\nGabriel Haritos, as the Mayor of Rhodes, was the local partner for the proceedings for the initial talks between Israel, Egypt and Jordan, under the auspices of United Nations, at the Grande Albergo delle Rose (Hotel of Roses) in Rhodes from January 12 to April 4, 1949.\r\n\r\nThese meetings resulted to the agreements for the seize of fire on February and April 1949, also defining the borders of the newly founded Jewish state with Egypt and Jordan. These defined borders were active till the Six Days War of 1967.\r\n\r\nToday there are a handful of Jews living in Rhodes, who practice their religion in the Synagogue of the Community. However, it is worth mentioning that the Synagogue is also open to the public that visit it because of its great historic and architectural interest. In 2002 the Municipality approved the erection of a Monument of the Victims of the Holocaust in the Jewish Martyrs square, in the place where the Jewish quarter used to be. The Jewish cemetery of the island is still preserved.","buildings":"The Jewish Museum of Rhodes is located next o the Synagogue «Kahal Shalom» in the same complex.\r\nThe Kahal Shalom is the oldest Jewish synagogue in Greece, and the sole remaining synagogue on the Island of Rhodes in use. There were once six synagogues and prayer halls in the Jewish Quarter (called “La Juderia”). The Kahal Shalom is located on Dossiadou and Simiou Streets and is believed to have been built in the year 1577. The full name of the building is “Kahal Kadosh Shalom” (Holy Congregation of Peace). It is used for prayer services when visitors or former residents and their families visit the Island for Friday night prayer services, High Holiday services and for special occasions.\r\nThe interior of the Kahal Shalom synagogue follows the traditional Sephardic style of having the “tevah” (the prayer reading table) in the center of the sanctuary facing southeast toward Jerusalem. The floor is decorated with graceful black and white mosaic stone patterns, which is a distinctive design motif used throughout the Old City of Rhodes.\r\nDuring the 1930’s, a balcony was built in the Kahal Shalom sanctuary for seating of the women. Prior to that time the women sat in rooms adjoining the south wall of the synagogue. The women’s prayer rooms (known in Ladino as “la azara”) viewed the sanctuary through windowed openings adorned by latticework.\r\nIn the courtyard on the east side of the synagogue, there is a plaque above where a water fountain once existed, and it bears an inscription dated the month of Kislev, 5338 (1577). Apparently, this fountain was constructed at the same time as the synagogue. On the west side of the synagogue there was a religious school (“yeshiva”), however it was destroyed during World War II.An intriguing feature of the Kahal Shalom sanctuary is that it is decorated with numerous religious wall paintings.\r\n","holdings":"The Museum started as an exhibition of photographic material that was collected from Rhodian Jews of Diaspora, documenting prewar Jewish life on Rhodes.\r\n\r\nToday the Museum holds various artifacts donated by diaspora Rhodians, like religious artifacts, historical documents, religious books, costumes and domestic textiles.","openingTimes":"The Museum is open from:\r\n\r\n- April to October: Sundays to Friday: 10:00a.m-15:00p.m\r\n\r\n- November to March: Monday to Friday: 10:00a.m-15:00p.m **only upon arrangement**\r\n\r\nThe synagogue and the museum are closed for visits on Saturdays, Jewish festivals, local and state holidays.","accessibility":"The building has access for people with limited mobility only in the area of ​​the synagogue"},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"gr","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/gr-006598","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/gr-006598/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/gr"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2023-10-13T14:50:40.326Z"}},{"id":"at-001949","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Universitätsarchiv der Paris-Lodron-Universität Salzburg","parallelFormsOfName":["Salzburg University Archives"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Kapitelgasse 4-6","city":"Salzburg","region":"Salzburg","postalCode":"5020","country":"Austria","countryCode":"AT","email":["richard.apfelauer@sbg.ac.at"],"telephone":["(0662) 8044-2080"],"fax":["(0662) 6389-2080"],"url":["http://www.sbg.ac.at/dir/archiv/home.htm"]},"geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[47.797214,13.048138]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"at","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/at-001949","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/at-001949/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/at"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2023-10-05T08:05:11.857Z"}},{"id":"at-002001","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Diözesanarchiv Erzdiözese Wien","parallelFormsOfName":["Archive of the Archdiocese of Vienna"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Wollzeile 2","city":"Wien","region":"Wien","postalCode":"1010","country":"Austria","countryCode":"AT","email":["daw@edw.or.at"],"telephone":["(01) 51552-3239"],"fax":["(01) 51552-2240"],"url":["https://www.erzdioezese-wien.at/pages/inst/14428073"]},"geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[48.2093618,16.3737692]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"at","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/at-002001","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/at-002001/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/at"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2023-10-03T10:13:10.579Z"}},{"id":"at-006597","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":" Institute for Jewish History in Austria ","parallelFormsOfName":["Institut für jüdische Geschichte Österreichs"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Linzer Straße 16/7 ","city":"St. Poelten","region":"Lower Austria","postalCode":"A-3100","email":[],"telephone":[],"fax":[],"url":["http://www.injoest.ac.at/de"]},"history":"The Institute for Jewish History in Austria was founded in 1988 and is housed in the former synagogue of St. Pölten 60 kilometers west of Vienna.

The Commission's recommendation was to establish a memorial with three main components: a national Holocaust memorial/museum; an educational foundation; and a Committee on Conscience. In 1980, the United States Congress, by unanimous vote, established the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, with its mandate being the creation of a living memorial to the 6 million Jews and millions of other victims who perished during the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nDedication ceremonies for the Museum took place on April 22, 1993, and included speeches by President Bill Clinton; Chaim Herzog, president of Israel; Harvey Meyerhoff, chairman of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council; and Elie Wiesel, who had been awarded Nobel Peace Prize in 1986. Several days later, on April 26, the Museum officially opened to the public—with its first visitor being His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet.\r\n\r\nThe Museum building contains permanent and temporary exhibition spaces; Remember the Children: Daniel's Story—an exhibition for children and families that recounts the history of the Holocaust from the perspective of a child in Nazi Germany; an extensive research library and archives; two theaters; the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies; a Children's Tile Wall; an interactive computer learning center; classrooms; the Hall of Witness; a memorial space, the Hall of Remembrance; and an education center. The Permanent Exhibition The Holocaust spans three floors of the Museum building, and through historical documents, artifacts, photographs, film footage, historical and personal photographs, oral and video histories, and more, presents the full history of the Holocaust in three distinct sections: \"Nazi Assault,\" \"Final Solution,\" and \"Last Chapter.\"\r\n\r\nSpecial exhibitions presented by the Museum—in the Kimmel-Rowan Exhibition Gallery and in gallery space adjacent to the Gonda Education Center—provide compelling, detailed looks at special aspects of Holocaust history, and have included The Nazi Olympics: Berlin 1936, Flight and Rescue, Liberation, The Hidden History of the Kovno Ghetto, The Art and Politics of Arthur Szyk, Nazi Persecution of Homosexuals 1933–1945, Fighting the Fires of Hate: America and the Nazi Book Burnings, Anne Frank, the Writer: An Unfinished Story, Life in Shadows: Hidden Children and the Holocaust, and Deadly Medicine: Creating the Master Race.\r\n\r\nSince the opening, traveling exhibitions and the Museum's public programs have extended the reach of the institution's resources to dozens of communities across the United States, and Days of Remembrance commemorations are now held across the country every April. In addition, the Museum's Web site provides a vast amount of content, including the Holocaust Encyclopedia, special focus pages about topics of current interest, access to the Museum's document and photo collections, Committee on Conscience presentations, and online versions of past and present Museum exhibitions.

In 1936 the Potsdam Army Archives were hived off from the Reich Archives as an independent institution. An air raid in April 1945 destroyed many collections that had not been relocated. In 1955 a Military Archives Department was set up again in the Federal Archives in Koblenz and moved to Freiburg in 1968 incorporating the holdings of the Central Documents Office of the Agency for Research into Military History (Militaergeschichtliches Forschungsamt). In Potsdam the Military Archives of the GDR National People's Army (NVA) were founded in 1964.

Moreover, documents pertaining to the Nationale Volksarmee (National People's Army, NVA) and the Grenztruppen (Border Troops) of the GDR are archived in Freiburg. The greatest part of the documentation preserved in the Military Archives Department comes from the Federal Ministry of Defence and its subordinate military and civil areas. Many personal papers of German military personnel and related collections pertaining to German military history since the middle of the 19th Century round off the records profile.\r\nThe archival material from the period up to 1945 suffered considerable losses as a consequence of war. Many of the records of the central service units of the armed forces and of the army leadership, those of the service units and troops of the army below divisional level and those of the air force and the Waffen SS have been lost. Naval archives, on the other hand, and the bulk of war logs belonging to the command authorities of the army and the divisional headquarters up to 1943, survived the war.

Throughout the war years, he and his assistants continued to collect information and documents on Germany’s occupation policy, responses to it, and particularly the fate of the European Jewry. During the war, the Center, which came to be known as Dr. Wiener's Library and later the Wiener Library, was used by the British Ministry of Information and the Allied governments. When the war ended, Holocaust survivors' testimonies, as well as information regarding the fate of Jewish refugees, were collected. Up until his death in 1964, Dr. Wiener and his team continued expanding the collection. \r\n     In the late 1970s, the board of the Wiener Library in London decided to transfer the entire collection (journals, books, microfilms and archival material) to Tel Aviv University where it is located today.\r\n\r\n","generalContext":"The Wiener Library for the Study for the Study of the Nazi Era and the Holocaust is a steadily growing research library and comprises old and new publications on the Third Reich, during and between the two world wars, Jewish communities in Europe, the Holocaust, anti-Semitism, and fascism throughout the world.

Central Service, which lasted for several decades, finally found its solution through the operation of the new building in Psychiko.  From the establishment of the G.S.A, until the opening ceremony of the new building (10.11.2003), the Service was accommodated in the basement of Athens Academy, in the basement of the Old Parliament building, and in various buildings all over Athens (building in Theatrou Street, in Ermou Street, in Kallithea).The financial contribution of Prodromos Athanasiadis - Mpodosakis for the construction of the building in a property owned by the Greek State was significant.The construction works started on 1972. Bureaucracy and financial reasons delayed the beginning of works until 1979, when the building's frame was constructed.  The building remained unfinished until 1998, when its completion was undertaken by the Organization for School Buildings. The structure was basically completed in the three-year period of 2000-2003 under the supervision of OSB. The structure, of 6.500 m2 total surface, is organized in six successive levels (A-F, starting from the ground): The main entrance was placed in level D, along with the reception and lobby, the lecture and seminars hall, and with part of the offices. Level E, in the form of a mezzanine with open balconies overlooking level D, houses the remaining offices and the cafeteria.  Level F contains the Reading room, along with the Library and the Directorate's offices. The repositories are located in levels A, B and C. Level A is underground and contains the special, shielded protection area for precious documents, a large hall for storing documents (745 m2) and the rooms for the electromechanical facilities. In levels B and C, there are six (1202 m2) and four (745 m2) rooms respectively, where archives are kept. The two specific floors, following ground inclination, have only a section of their perimeter wall outside the ground, while their roofs are external accessible terraces, paved with marble, which reach to the natural soil.  In the back section of level C (above ground level), there is the entrance to the archived material, the disinsection chamber, the classification halls and the laboratories for maintenance, binding and photo shooting.

In April 1833, King Otto issued a royal decree aimed at the reconstruction of the state, making radical changes in almost all the basic institutions. This decree provided, amongst other things, for the foundation of an Archives Section as part of the newly constituted 'Secretariat of Foreign Affairs'. It was not until 1910, however, that an Archive Service with specific responsibilities and tasks was founded within the M.F.A. under the jurisdiction of the General Director of Political Affairs. \r\nDuring the German Occupation (1941-1944) the operation of the Foreign Ministry, and by extension of all its Services, was suspended, and access to the archives was strictly forbidden. After the liberation of Greece the record groups were in complete disarray: it became clear that the collection had been partly ransacked and selectively destroyed. Some of the files had been carried off when the Occupation forces departed for Germany, while a number of documents had been removed and destroyed, as was evident from the gaps found in the chronological sequence of the record groups when they were returned in sacks by the American army. The task of reclassifying the archives began in 1945 and was completed five years later. Although the Foreign Ministry files became available to scholars in 1959, research continued to be at a rudimentary level in terms of means and organisation of material, and also of the number of researchers who showed interest in the respective files. It was only after 1994 that significant progress in the reorganisation and modernisation of the Directorate of Archives in all respects has been achieved. This significant progress, can, to a large extent, be attributed to the re-establishment and upgrading of the Directorate of Archives, which, according to the New Regulation of the Hellenic Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1998), was renamed as the Service of Historical Archives. ","holdings":"The Service of Diplomatic & Historical Archives (Y.D.I.A.) of the Hellenic Ministry of Foreign Affairs (M.F.A.) is responsible for the diplomatic records of the Greek authorities abroad (Embassies, Consulates, Permanent Delegations, Liaison Offices) and also has the management of the Library and the Film Archive together with its subsidiary departments (Photographic Archive and Digitisation Laboratory) of the M.F.A. After many years of efforts, Y.D.I.A. with the assistance of the Ministry’s Special Secretariat for the Development of International Programs succeeded in integrating in the NSRF Operational Programme \"Digital Convergence 2007-2013\" the project of digitization of the Ministry Central Service’s archival material of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. After the completion of a selection procedure in the fall of 2012, the implementation of the project began in the summer of 2013 and the outcome is scheduled to be finally delivered by the end of the 2014. The result of the project is the digitization of more than 4,000,000 pages of archival material of the period 1821-1923, which from January 2015 will be available to researchers through local terminals in the Y.D.I.A reading-room and online.","openingTimes":"The reading room is open Monday to Friday: 9.30 am to 14.30 pm.

It was stipulated in the law that one of the archives should be located in Jutland. MPs from Aarhus, Vejle, Randers and Viborg tried to get the new archive located in  their hometown. After lengthily discussions in parliament Viborg was selected. The Viborg Municipality donated the building site and the State paid for the construction of a new archive building.  In addition, two other national archives were set up in the province: in Odense and Copenhagen. All three national archives were subdivisions under the Danish National Archives. The regional archives in Aabenraa joined in 1931.\r\n\r\nSeveral archives dating back prior to the 1920s are shared by The Danish National Archives, Aabenraa and Landesarchiv Schleswig-Holstein in the town of Schleswig (in present-day Germany). The historical development means that in many ways the archives maintained in Aabenraa differ from the other locations archives. In particular, this applies to:\r\n\r\n- Archives from the Schleswig provincial administration and local administration until 1864;\r\n- The archives of the local administration during the Prussian rule, from 1867 to 1920;\r\n- Numerous private association archives and personal papers from the national campaign  since the 1840s;\r\n- Archives relating to the German minority during the Nazi rule, the occupation, and the later judicial purge; this includes archives seized from the German minority, 1920-1945.\r\n\r\nLike the other regional archives, The Danish National Archives have numerous records of great importance to genealogists. This includes Parish Registers (the oldest one dating back to 1573), census lists, civilian birth and death bi-registers (from 1874), registers of debts, pledges and mortgages (the oldest dates back to 1669), and land registers (approximately 1880-1950).\r\n\r\nThe National Archives for Southern Jutland is part of the Danish National Archives. Geographically, it covers the area from Kongeåen to the current national border, i.e. the parts of Southern Jutland that came to Denmark at the reunification in 1920 - now Sønderjyllands amt. The National Archives receives and stores records from the local government offices and institutions in its area.

In the days of liberation in 1945 there was an urgent need for facilities, where Danes, who had collaborated with the German occupationel power, could be interned. The Frøslev Camp was fit for this purpose. The camp was renamed Faarhus Camp and used until 1949 as an internment- and prison camp for collaborators.\r\n\r\nSince 1965, a memorial site in Frøslev - located in close vicinity to the German border - has been commemorating the former »Police Internment Camp Frøslev«.

The initiative for the museum arose from a group of private individuals who were involved in various ways in a series of exhibitions that were shown in Copenhagen in 1984 on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the Mosaic Faith Community. Several of these were involved in the Society for Danish Jewish History, which at the time was the only organizational framework for work with Danish Jewish history. The Art Association Gammel Strand showed the exhibition Within the walls. Jewish art and culture in Denmark. An exhibition about Jewish life was shown at Copenhagen City Hall You must tell your children. The special exhibition Kings and Citizens celebrated the Jubilee of the Faith Society in the United States. From this work arose the idea to establish a Jewish museum in Copenhagen, so that the public had a permanent opportunity to encounter Jewish culture in Denmark.\r\n\r\nThe museum was anchored in a commercial foundation that was founded in 1985 with Hans Weinberger as the museum's first board chairman. The museum has since had its own board and has been an independent institution. The museum was state-recognised from 1 January 2011, and the Danish Jewish cultural heritage thereby became part of Denmark's cultural heritage. The museum manages this special part of Denmark's cultural heritage, is subject to the Act on Museums in Denmark and has the Cultural Heritage Agency as the supervisory authority.\r\n\r\nSince its early beginnings in 1985, the museum has received support and help from countless individuals and foundations. In addition, the Mosaic Faith Society has made a significant donation to the museum's collection, which was transferred to the museum's ownership upon state recognition on 1 January 2011. Part of this donation can be seen in the museum's exhibition.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, the museum launched an extensive research and dissemination project on the wartime experiences of Danish Jews from 1943-1945.

It is considered the first museum in the city of Casablanca, and the only Jewish museum in the Arab region.\r\n\r\nThe Murdock Bengio Children's Home is the former name of the building that now houses the museum, an orphanage for the protection of Jewish children. ","generalContext":"[Specific contribution and Interaction](https://www.jewishmuseumcasa.com/introduction)\r\n\r\nThe written production of Moroccan rabbis is very abundant. Although it is essentially Hebrew literature, it is nonetheless a reflection, from a given angle, of a Moroccan reality, of a society that is predominantly Arab-Islamic. This is particularly evident in legal writings(3). The collections of jurisprudence are a telling source of information on past centuries in the fields of economic life, social life, customs, etc. They also reveal how much the environment can influence local Mosaic law. After the arrival of the refugees from Spain, a long dispute arose between immigrant and local rabbis, especially in Fez. The Sephardic code was eventually recognised as a reference, but in combination with Moroccan customs, such as bigamy, which was legal until 1948.\r\nMoroccan literary production in Hebrew embraces other fields: theological and cabalistic thought, chronicles, poetry. It is part of the heritage of Judaism, but it remains inseparable from the surrounding culture, in more than one way. H. Zafrani has shown how much poetry is indebted to Arab models for structure, rhyme, rhythm, etc. It is generally intended to be sung to an Andalusian musical theme.\r\nIn the vast field of popular culture, the Moroccan background is much more apparent; but the specificity remains marked. The two poles of social life are felt: economic and professional life, the multiple contributions with Muslim society open the community to regional and national influences, while family life, culture and community institutions give a specific Jewish stamp to cultural expressions and manifestations. In the countryside, where cohabitation is more direct and the community's weight less enveloping, the specificity may be less marked.\r\nThe overall result is a typically Moroccan Judaism with its own personality even within the Sephardic rite, with its minhag (religious tradition), its liturgical music, its particular feasts and celebrations, its cult of saints, its moussems (hillulot), its legends and, beyond orthodoxy, superstitions and magical practices.\r\nAll of this is reflected in popular creations, individual or collective, in fields ranging from language to literature, music, applied arts... and cuisine.","buildings":"Built in 1948 by Mrs. Celia Bengio in memory of her late husband Murdock Bengio. The building, which covers an area of 600m2, was refurbished by the architect Aimé Kakon in 1995-1996.\r\nThe Museum of Moroccan Judaism, a private ethnographic museum, consists of two distinct spaces:\r\n- A space reserved for the temporary exhibition\r\n- A second space, comprising 3 rooms, for the permanent exhibition.\r\n- The course of the permanent exhibition gives a privileged place to the valorization of the authenticity of the Moroccan Judaïca, as well as to the diversity of the Moroccan synagogues and their interior.","holdings":"The initial collection of the Museum of Moroccan Judaism consists essentially of cult objects, objects of worship of Moroccan tradition, called: Moroccan Judaica.\r\nSince the opening of the museum, missions have been carried out to collect objects abandoned in synagogues throughout the country.\r\nThis approach, undertaken by the late Simon Levy, assisted by Zhor Rehihil, has enabled the recovery and the constitution of the first part of the collection:\r\n- Singers' platforms\r\n- Circumcision chairs\r\n- Traditional lamps with their supports\r\n- Torah scrolls\r\n- Torah covers\r\n- Tombstones (from southern cemeteries)\r\n- Prayer books\r\n\r\nThis initial collection has also been enriched over the years by donations from individuals who have given the museum\r\n- Torah ornaments\r\n- Hanukkah lamps\r\n- Megilotes\r\n- Bar mitzvah bags\r\n\r\nSince its creation, the Museum of Moroccan Judaism, thanks to its former director, has developed a policy of acquisition which has fed the museum with exceptional objects such as\r\n- A meguillah of Hitler\r\n- A keswa kbira (Corcos family)\r\n- Hanukkah lamps\r\n- A rare Azemmour embroidery\r\n- Judeo-Moroccan manuscripts (such as the Call of Azzouz Cohen)","openingTimes":"Winter opening hours:\r\n- Monday to Friday: 10am to 5pm\r\n- Sunday: 11am to 4pm\r\n\r\nSummer opening hours:\r\n- Monday to Friday: 10am to 6pm\r\n- Sunday: 11am to 4pm\r\n\r\nTimetables change during the month of Ramadan","conditions":"Professionals, researchers, students and tourists.

By students being active participants in the project, they learn more about the Holocaust and recognize the relevance of these testimonies in today’s society.
