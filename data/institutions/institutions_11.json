archival service of Kyrgyzstan began on August 30, 1926, when the Oblast Executive Committee of the Kyrgyz Autonomous Region, which at that time was the supreme body of state power, adopted a resolution “On the organization of archival affairs in the KAO and putting in order the archival material in institutions located in KAO \". \r\n       In accordance with this resolution, on September 1, 1926, the Archive Bureau was established at the regional executive committee of the KAO, which was responsible for organizing archival affairs in Kyrgyzstan. The archives in the districts were headed by district executive committees, with whom the Archival Bureau maintained a close relationship. Their task was to identify and record the available archival materials in all institutions and create a local Unified State Archive Fund from these materials.\r\nFrom 1992 to 2005, regional, district and city archives were subordinate to the departments of archives and documentation under regional state administrations. In accordance with the Decree of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic of November 30, 2005 No. 607 “On Optimization of the Structure of State Bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic”, regional offices were liquidated and their functions were transferred to regional state archives.\r\n      Currently, there are 65 state archives in the Kyrgyz Republic: 3 central, 8 regional (in Osh oblast 2), 53 district and city state archives, 1 territorial archive (Suusamyr in Chui oblast). Central, regional (except for the Osh state archive of political documentation) state archives, as well as the Bishkek and Osh city state archives are directly subordinate to the State Archival Agency under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. The remaining city, district state archives, the Osh state archive of political documentation, the Jayil branch of the Chui regional state archive and the Suusymir territorial archive are under the jurisdiction of the regional state archives.","conditions":"In order to obtain access to archives in Kyrgyzstan foreign nationals should submit a written application on site. It will be best if they have a ready official letter from their institution describing their goal and subject of the research.  Usually access (at least to the catalogue) is granted the same date, but it is strongly advised to contact the archive in advance. Written permission is given by the director of the archive and good for one calendar year. There are no archival guides available online and only few printed available on site, but they are very limited and fragmental.","researchServices":"Application form http://archive.kg/services/application.html ","reproductionServices":"Price-list http://archive.kg/services/price%20current.html ","publicAreas":"Standards of public services http://archive.kg/services/standard_services.html "},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"kg","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/kg-006384","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/kg-006384/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/kg"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2019-10-24T10:38:39.084Z"}},{"id":"bg-002201","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Дирекция \"Информация и архив\"  на Министерството на вътрешните работи","parallelFormsOfName":["Direktsiya \"Informatsiya i arhiv\" na Ministerstvoto na vutreshnite raboti"],"otherFormsOfName":["Information and Archives Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs"],"address":{"streetAddress":"ulitsa Shesti Septemvri 29","city":"Sofia","postalCode":"1000","country":"Bulgaria","countryCode":"BG","email":[],"telephone":["02 982 24 72"],"fax":[],"url":["https://www.mvr.bg/dia/начало"]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"bg","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/bg-002201","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/bg-002201/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/bg"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2019-10-24T08:31:51.356Z"}},{"id":"bg-002205","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Дипломатически архив на Министерството на външните работи","parallelFormsOfName":["Diplomaticheski arhiv na Ministerstvoto na vunshnite raboti"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"city":"Sofia","country":"Bulgaria","countryCode":"BG","email":[],"telephone":[],"fax":[],"url":[]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"bg","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/bg-002205","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/bg-002205/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/bg"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2019-10-24T08:05:41.465Z"}},{"id":"bg-002197","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Държавен архив – Русе","parallelFormsOfName":["Durzhaven arhiv - Ruse","State Archive in Ruse"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"38, Lipnik Boulevard","city":"Ruse","postalCode":"7005","country":"Bulgaria","countryCode":"BG","email":["ruse@archives.government.bg"],"telephone":["+359 82841867 – head of division","+359 82662328 – reading room "],"fax":["+359 82841866"],"url":["https://www.archives.government.bg/55-Русе","http://www.archives.government.bg/55-%D0%A0%D1%83%D1%81%D0%B5","http://212.122.187.196:84/FundSearch.aspx"]},"history":"State Archive in Ruse was created in 1952.

From 1 May 1941 Arbeitslager Gross-Rosen was an autonomous concentration camp with its own network of 77 dependant sub-camps across Lower Silesia. This was one of the harshest of the labour camps, where prisoners were employed on particularly hard tasks, among them the construction of an underground complex intended as the headquarters of the supreme command of the Third Reich in the Owl Mountains. Some 125,000 prisoners passed through the camp and its sub-camps, and the number of lives they claimed was probably about 40,000, among whom the largest single group was Jews from various different countries. The museum is the custodian of the former site of the camp and the quarries. It is now a local-authority funded institution. The Gross-Rosen Museum in Rogoźnica came into existence in 1947.The main task of this institution is gathering historical documents connected with the KL Gross-Rosen, scientific research, popularization of the historical knowledge about World War II, and protection of the camp's relics and their presentation. The Museum is composed of three departments: Holdings' Protection, Scientific Research, and Education. The important part of the Museum is an archive.","holdings":"The archive of the Gross-Rosen Museum possesses the following kinds of documents:\r\n- Written documents (the camp's death-registers, diaries and testimonies of the prisoners, the transport checklists of the prisoners, the copies of trial records concerning the camp (after 1945), collections of various documents (mostly letters of the former prisoners) created after 1945, the extracts of the death registers concerning the prisoners.\r\n- Questionnaires concerning the life in the camp prepared by the Museum.\r\n- The letters (also: written beyond camp censorship, so-called grypsy). \r\n- Photographs: photographs of the camp and its branches, the prisoners and members of the staff.\r\n- The maps of the camp.\r\nThe archive comprises above all secondary documentation in the form of copies (microfilms, photocopies, scans) from other archives, at present some 10,000 items.

It sources other materials through painstaking research in the archives of the Polish Red Cross, the IPN, the State Archives, and the archives of other museums of martyrdom. At its foundation, a questionnaire was composed for former prisoners for the purpose of gathering and supplementing their biographical details. The museum also records eye-witness accounts and interviews on audio and video tape.

The archival holdings were taken over by the Government Commission of Religious Confessions and Education (Komisja Rządowa Wyznań Religijnych i Oświecenia Publicznego) and later: by the archive of the Warsaw Education District. The University (as a Main School - Szkoła Główna) was reactivated in 1862. In June 1915, before of the evacuation of Russian administration from Warsaw, the significant part of the University holdings was transferred to Russia. The small part of records remained in Warsaw as  part of the Public Enlightenment Archive (Archiwum Oświecenia Publicznego) - an important University department. The significant part of holdings burned at the beginning of World War II. Only a minority of collections was protected in the building of the Library. In 1940-1942 they were relocated to the building of the Archive of Modern Records in Rakowiecka street and evacuated from Warsaw before Warsaw Uprising. Thanks to it - they survived. After 1945 all records were preserved in the University offices. In 1955 the Records Store of University Acts was established.

With the foundation act of June 1817 he handed over to the Polish nation valuable collections of books, manuscripts and museum pieces, and at the same time he defined the character of the Institute’s activity, which was to save the cultural heritage of the nation devoid of its statehood by drawing on the resources of Polish literature and museum collections.\r\n\r\nThe source of the Institute’s upkeep were revenues from the Founder’s landed estates. From 1827 to 1945 the Institute was housed in Lwów and its existence was vital to the activities of the Faculty of the Humanities of the Jan Kazimierz University.\r\n\r\nInitially, the Institute was to consist of two branches: the Library and the Publishing House. However, as a result of an agreement between Józef Maksymilian Ossoliński and Prince Henryk Lubomirski, who decided to hand over his own museum collections to the Institute, a third section was created in 1824 by the name of the Lubomirski Museum. The post of the literary curator – the Institute’s highest authority – was to become a hereditary function of the Lubomirski family. From the very beginning, the Institute served Polish science and education and cultivated patriotic traditions. In the years of national bondage the Ossolineum published Monumenta Poloniae Historica, a critical edition of Samuel Bogumił Linde’s Słownik Języka Polskiego (Dictionary of the Polish Language) and numerous other works from the fields of history, history of Poland, literary sciences and history of culture, important for the Polish science.\r\n\r\nIn the period of the Second Republic (1918-1939) the Institute developed dynamically. It published scientific works as well as belles lettres and became one the leading publishing houses of the independent Poland. During that time the Ossolineum holdings were enriched by many new collections, including those of the Lubomirski family of Kruszyna, the Potocki family of Raj, and the Jabłonowski family of Bursztyn, as well as by numerous bequests made by Polish scholars.\r\n\r\nDuring the Second World War the printed collections of the Library were doubled as many private collections were stored there for safety, including those of the Baworowski and Dzieduszycki families as well as numerous donations and deposits made by the civilian population. During World War II, the already numerous and valuable collections of the Ossolineum first fell into Soviet hands and then passed to the Germans. In July 1941 the government of the GG appointed Mieczysław Gębarowicz custodian of the Ossoliński Foundation. When in early 1944 the Germans planned to remove some of the objects to the Third Reich, it was he who “took advantage of the situation for his own evacuation plans for the Polish collections. The most precious of the Ossolineum collections were packed into two transports (around 2,300 manuscripts, around 2,200 diplomas, around 1,800 old prints and around 2,300 drawings (...). In March and April 1944 they were transported to Kraków, where they were to see out the war in the safety of the Jagiellonian Library cellars, but in July 1944 the German authorities decided to move them to the Reich. The transport was abandoned in the village of Adelin (now Zagrodno, Poland) in Lower Silesia, and it was here, after the end of hostilities, that the Poles found them.\r\n\r\nAfter the war Lwów was incorporated into the Soviet Union. Only a part of the Ossolineum collections was transferred from Lwów to Wrocław. These collections were made accessible to the public as early as September 1947. The source of the Institute’s upkeep in the new historical circumstances, after the nationalisation in 1945 of all landed estates, was the state treasury. In 1953, the Ossolineum Library and Publishing House were transformed into branches of the newly created Polish Academy of Sciences. The Ossolineum collections constituted a scholarly workshop for the Wroclaw humanities as they reemerged after the war. The bulk of the collections remained, however, in Lwów, including autographs, diplomas, drawings and prints, photographs, numismatic objects, medals, seals, periodicals and a part of the manuscript collections. At present a report is being prepared on the losses sustained by the Ossolineum Library as a result of the change of national borders after the Second World War. These losses are estimated at about 60 percent. Efforts are being made to recover the Ossolineum collections.\r\n\r\nIn 1990 the post of Ossolineum’s director was assumed by Dr Adolf Juzwenko , who undertook efforts to reactivate the Foundation – the original status of the Institute. On January 5, 1995 the Parliament of the Republic of Poland passed the act on „the foundation – the Ossoliński National Institute (Official Gazette 1995, no. 23, item 121). On the strength of this act patronage over the Institute was assumed by the President of the Republic of Poland and the direct supervision is performed by the Board of Curators.\r\n\r\nFor almost two hundred years of the Institute’s activity, the collections handed over by the Founder to the Polish nation have constantly been enlarged, mainly through donations, exchange and purchase. Altogether, the Ossolineum collections of the nineteenth and twentieth century books and periodicals, old books, manuscripts, prints, maps and numismatic objects comprise at present ca 1,800,000 items. It is a constantly growing stock. Each year ca 10,000 books and 5,000 units of periodicals are added to it. Special collections grow by several hundred items yearly.","holdings":"The Ossolineum is one of the largest scientific libraries in Poland, second to none as far as the collections in the field of the humanities are concerned. The acquisitions profile has been defined as humanistic with special stress being laid on Polish and Slavic history, culture and literature. In this respect, the Ossolineum collections are unique not only in Poland but also worldwide. For scholars of the Holocaust, the most important is the manuscripts section (of which some 17,500 items have been catalogued), which contains a chronologically and formally diverse range of historical materials. Alongside archivalia from a variety of institutions, legacies and papers including family collections, mementoes and correspondence, without a doubt the most important is the collection of memoirs recorded during World War II or shortly after the war. This collection runs into several thousand; they are successively being catalogued and released for scholarly use. The catalogues of the Ossoliński Institute are accessible on its website. Also worthy of note are the collections recently donated by Professor Władysław Bartoszewski, a member of Rada Pomocy Żydom „Żegota” (the “Żegota” Council to Aid Jews), and Jan Nowak-Jeziorański (the legendary World War II courier who smuggled documents from occupied Poland to London), which catalogues are also accessible online.\r\n\r\nAmong the memoirs that may contain documents of interest in respect to this subject are the following:\r\n\r\n13170/II, Antoni Mikulski, O czym zapomnieć nie wolno!...

The man responsible for planning motorway routes and engaging the contractors to build them was Dr Fritz Todt, “chief inspector for German roads”, appointed in 1933. He created the paramilitary Organisation Todt (OT), which employed prisoners and forced labourers in the construction of military sites until the end of the war. The camp and Gestapo prison operated from April 1943 as a continuation of the function of the Fort VII Prison in Poznań. Individuals suspected by the Gestapo of enemy activity in respect of the Third Reich were incarcerated here for the duration of their investigation and interrogations (for several days or weeks). From here, prisoners were sent to the concentration camps Auschwitz, Gross-Rosen, Mauthausen, Sachsenhausen and Ravensbrück. The prison was intended above all for Poles.\r\nThe museum on the site today was founded in order to commemorate both institutions – the slave labour camp for Jews engaged on the construction of motorways in the Wartheland (Warta region) and the Gestapo prison for Poles.The Martyrdom Museum in Żabikowo was created in 1979. The Museum is located in the space over 3 hectare along motor-way A2. There are the monuments commemorated the martyrdom of Poles, Jews, Luxemburgians, Dutch, Soviet Union citizens, and other nationalities.   \r\nIn 2013 the Museum of the Former Extermination Camp in Chełmno nad Nerem (Kulmhof), created 1990, became the filial institution of the Żabikowo museum.","buildings":"The Museum is composed of the three parts: the territory of the camp, the place of the Museum building, and the monumental space in Czołów (near Kórnik).
