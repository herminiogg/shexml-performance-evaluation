With this decision its old name was returned – the Archives of Yugoslavia, instead of the Archives of Serbia and Montenegro, their name since 2003. The activities of the Archives have remained unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe internal structure of the Archives of Yugoslavia followed, developed and were fine-tuned simultaneously with the development of the needs and opportunities for the protection of archival records at state level.\r\n\r\nIn the period following its establishment, namely from 1950 - 1959 the structure of the Archives reflected and dovetailed with the main tasks, which were primarily to locate, register, gather and sort public records for which the Archives were responsible. In 1959, the Federal Executive Council adopted its first act laying down the structure of the Archives. It was important not only in that it was the first such act passed by a public authority but also in that it established a separate department within the Archives for the information on archival records. This was an indicator of the fact that, in the period until that date, the Archives had managed to complete a large number of technical tasks with its records that were now in a condition that made it possible to use them and get more detailed information about the holdings and collections.\r\n\r\nThe next act on the structure of the Archives was passed in 1965, which determined its definite structure. It was much more complex than before and had well-defined structural segments each responsible for a particular type of technical duties. This structure included a separate segment for the protection of archival records outside the Archives; namely, a library was established. The sorting out and processing of archival material took place in two separate structural segments depending on the periodisation of the holdings in question.\r\n\r\nThe new structure was put in place in 1973 following the adoption of the Law on the Archives for the first time providing for the establishment of a department for the special protection of archival records and a somewhat changed structure for the sorting out and processing of public records. According to the structure in place in 1978 when the Archives was once again incorporated into the government administration structure, the duties were divided up between two departments: the first covered archival duties and the second - legal and technical protection of archival records. Lower-level structural segments - sections were introduced, too. \r\n\r\nThe structure of the Archives in 1979 and 1980 included, for the first time, a research group as a separate structural segment. The sorting out and processing of records took place within the structural segments that were set up depending on the activity of the entities producing holdings and collections.\r\nFurther changes in the Archives' structure (until 2000) made it possible for a large number of duties to be streamlined in terms of human and technical resources.\r\nThe structure of the Archives in 2000 included two departments: the department for supervision, protection, sorting out, processing and use of archival records and the department for the application of information technologies, publishing of archival records, cultural and educational activity and international cooperation. In addition to the two departments, there was also a Section for Legal and Administrative Affairs. \r\nIn 2003 the first Act on the Structure of the Archives was passed within the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. The duties are performed by three departments as the main structural segments notably: the department for the protection of archival records, information and use; the department for sorting out and processing of archival records; and the department for IT applying and technical protection of archival records. Within each of these departments there are two lower-level structural segments - (5) units and (1) desk. Apart from these three departments, there is also a separate Legal, Material-Financial and Administrative Affairs Section. The salient features of this structure of the Archives are the following: the activities of the Archives are accurately defined; the performance of the duties and tasks presupposes an adequate working methodology and personnel; the technological process for a particular technical assignment or task is complete and structural segments are coherent and mutually interlinked making it possible to achieve maximum efficiency throughout the Archives.\r\nWhen the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro ceased to exist in May 2006, the Republic of Serbia became an independant state and acquired successor state status. The Republic of Serbia, based on the Decree on Financing Competencies, which were transferred from the former state union to the Republic of Serbia, has continued to finance competencies of the Archives of Serbia and Montenegro. The Archives of Serbia and Montenegro existed under this name from 2003 until 19th February 2009, when by the Decision of the Government of the Republic of Serbia the Archives of Yugoslavia was established, as a cultural institution.\r\n","mandates":"Activities of the Archives are regulated by laws and by-laws and the activities are as follows:\r\n- protection of archival holdings outside the Archives\r\n- admission, storage and protection of archival holdings in the Archives\r\n- organisation and processing of archival holdings\r\n- information about the funds and archival holdings from the competence of the Archives\r\n- provision of conditions for the use of archival holdings\r\n- publication of archival holdings, means of information about archival holdings and other publications promoting the use of archival holdings\r\n- exhibitions of archival holdings, organisation of lectures and other forms of cultural and educational activities\r\n- research and photographing of archival holdings in the country and abroad for the purpose of completing the funds of the Archives\r\n- application of new technologies in all fields of work of the Archives, in line with the positive practice of other Archives and similar institutions in the country and abroad\r\n- technical protection of archival holdings\r\n- cooperation with archives and other similar institutions and associations in the country and abroad\r\n- implementation of the Agreement on Succession Issues, Annex D – Archives, regarding the \"SFRY State Archives\". ","administrativeStructure":"Presently, there are 47 employees with following qualifications at the Archives:\r\n29 people with university degrees, including two with PhDs\r\n 8 people with college diplomas\r\n10 people with secondary school diplomas","buildings":"The building of the Archives of Yugoslavia was built as an endowment of King Alexander I Karadjordjević according to the design of architect Vojin Petrović. Built for over two years, between July 5, 1931 and July 15, 1933, the three-storey building built in the style of academicism, with the useful area of about 8,000 square metres and the main façade facing Topčiderska Zvezda, was initially named Home of King Alexander I for secondary school students. According to the diaries of students of the school, a bust of King Alexander was situated in the yard.\r\nThe building kept its original use for a short time. The Gestapo and German military command moved in at the beginning of World War II, and between the liberation and 1953 it was used for accommodating political school students and holding classes. After that the building was taken over and used by the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs until 1970. At the beginning, the building was used as the seat of the Educational Centre of Internal Affairs and later it housed the Pane Đukić Home of Internal Affairs Workers. The decision to grant the building to the Archives was made by the Federal Executive Council at the March 19, 1969 session.\r\nIn the yard in the direction of the front entrance, there is a bust of King Alexander I, placed there in 2003. The king’s name and the years of birth and death can be read on the base, made from the sandstone from Bele Vode. The bronze bust was made on the model of the bust that was made by sculptor Slavko Miletić and cast in the Belgrade-based Bronza Foundry in 1936. Between 1952 and 2003, a bronze bust of Đuro Đaković by sculptor Stevan Bodnarov was situated on the same spot, on a stone base. Today, the bust of Đuro Đaković is on the ground floor of the building, next to the entrance to the reading room.\r\nThe building of the Archives of Yugoslavia was declared a monument of culture. The decision was published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia No. 30/2007 of March 27, 2007.","holdings":"From the period of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia 148 fonds have been preserved.\r\n\r\nThe number of record groups and the quantity of materials from this period would undoubtedly be larger had it not been for the large-scale devastation of this part of our cultural heritage too during World War II. Apart from that, selected archival records were systematically carted away by the occupying power.\r\nDespite the incompleteness of archival material from the period of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, record groups of the central bodies of authority and state administration in the spheres of internal and foreign policy, finance, economy, health, education, culture, welfare, justice, banking etc. constitute valuable and crucial sources for studying the history of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\nIn classifying and processing record groups, those from from the period of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia have been accorded priority in view of their having become accessible for use, and most of them have been processed and equipped with finding aids.

In 1965, the Law on the archival material and archives was adopted, according to which, the State Archive was renamed as the Archive of Macedonia, and the district archives as \"historical archives\". The State Archive of the Republic of North Macedonia was organised as an independent state administration body for performing archival activity throughout the entire state of the Republic of North Macedonia. In 1990, the new Law on Archives was adopted, by which the historical archives continued their operations as Departments within the State Archive of the Republic of North Macedonia. They are not legal entities, but dislocated organisational units of the State Archive of the Republic of North Macedonia and they perform archival functions within a particular territorial jurisdiction covering several municipalities. \r\n\r\nНа 23 јануари 1950 година е донесен првиот Општ закон за државните архиви во Југославија. На 6 јануари 1951 година, Народното собрание на Народна Република Македонија го донесе Законот за Државни архиви. Врз основа на Законот за државните архиви од 1 април 1951 година, е формиран Државниот архив на Народна Република Македонија, денес Државен архив на Република Македонија. Формирани се  и 9 околиски архиви во Скопје, Куманово, Велес, Тетово, Охрид, Штип, Струмица, Битола и Прилеп. Во 1965 година е донесен Законот за архивската граѓа и архивите, според кој Државниот архив се преименува во Архив на Македонија, а околиските архиви во историски архиви. Државниот архив на Република Македонија е организиран како самостоен орган на државната управа за вршење на архивска дејност на подрачјето на целата држава на РМ.\r\n\r\nВо 1990 година настапува интеграција на архивската служба во Македонија, кога е донесен нов Закон за архивски материјал според кој, историските архиви продолжуваат да работат како одделенија во состав на Државниот архив на Република Македонија. Тие немаат својство на правно лице, туку претставуваат дислоцирани организациони единици на Државниот архив, кои извршуваат архивски функции на одредено територијално подрачје од неколку општини. \r\n","holdings":"The State Archive of the Republic of North Macedonia holds over 1,331 fonds, 8,717 record books, 1,864 binders and 28 collections of documents, in total 56,484,000 documents, which equates to approximately four linear kilometres of material.

However, the systematic activity of gathering, preserving and processing historical archival material only began when the independent institution of the Royal State Archives (R. Archivio di Stato in Fiume) was founded on the 1 September 1926. The royal decree issued on the 6th of December 1928 attested the existence of the Archives in Rijeka, but only as a branch of the Royal State Archives in Trieste. That status and the same name (R. Archivio di Stato – Sezione di Fiume) remained until the end of Italian rule in Rijeka in 1945. In the Yugoslav State, Rijeka was united with the People’s Republic of Croatia, which ended the unnatural separation from her Croatian hinterland. From 1945 until 1947, the archives were run as an independent institution, as Državni Arhiv Rijeka. In February 1948, it became an integral part of the Zagreb State Archives under the name Ispostava Državnog Arhiva u Zagrebu. By the end of 1949, the archives reverted to their former name and status as an independent institution. In 1959, the name was changed to Historijski Arhiv Rijeka and it operated under that name until 1993, when the name changed once again into Povijesni Arhiv Rijeka. Absorbed into the independent Croatian State the Archives, it was been renamed in 1997 as Državni Arhiv u Rijeci, the name which is still in use today.","generalContext":"Throughout its seventy years' long existence, the archives have shared the fate of the town of Rijeka. Its achievements were restricted by specific conditions, in particular by the administrative and practical parameters in which the archives worked. Over time, the sphere of the Archives’ activity has gradually changed. From its foundation until 1945, the archives were active in the Kvarner Region which, in addition to Rijeka and the Liburnian part of Istria, encompassed a substantial part of Slovenian Karst. During the Second World War the scope of the Archives extended over parts of the south-western Croatia annexed by Italy. In the period after 1945 the Archives’ area of activity extended over the whole of Croatian Istria and over the islands of Cres, Lošinj and Krk. When an archival institution was founded in Pazin, in 1958, the Archives in Rijeka was left with a reduced sphere of activity which covered only the eastern, Liburnian part of Istria. The loss of its mandate in these parts was compensated by extension of the area of activity in Primorje (Croatian Littoral) and Gorski Kotar. At that time the Archives encompassed the regional sphere of activity which included the entire area of the Primorsko-Goranska county as well as the city of Senj in the Ličko-Senjska county. Frequent changes of governments in the area over which the competence of the Rijeka Archives extended resulted in closure of a number of administrative, legislative, military, educational and economic organisations, all of which left behind extensive archival material. As a consequence, the size of the archives' holdings increased considerably in a short space of time. ","administrativeStructure":"The ever increasing needs of the Archives have demanded a gradual increase of staff. From only three employees at the inception of the Archives the number has grown to twenty presently, among them ten professional archivists with the highest qualifications. \r\n\r\nThey work within the following departments:\r\n\r\n- Department for Archival Material, headed by Boris Zakošek, dipl.soc.\r\n\r\n- Department for Current Records, headed by Zoran Stanković, dipl.iur.\r\n\r\n- Library and Reading-room, headed by Mladen Urem, prof.\r\n\r\n- Department for Conservation and Restoration, headed by Iva Gobić Vitolović, prof.","buildings":"Today the building has a reading room sitting twenty researchers, a small lecture room with forty places and a fine exhibition hall.","holdings":"Today the Archives supervises more than 20,000 linear metres of current records in the County and in the city of Senj. Inside, there are 6,500 linear meters of archival storage as well as 740 archival collections. The oldest document deposited in the State Archives in Rijeka comes from the year 1201.\r\n\r\nThe language of the older records is predominantly Latin and Italian; only occasionally Croatian. In the second half of the 19th century German, Hungarian and Croatian languages predominated, while the material from the time of Italian rule (1918-1943) was written in Italian. Roman alphabet was the prevalent script, while the earlier documents were written in a variety of Gothic and Roman scripts.

Systematic care of the records started in the period after the end of Ottoman rule of Slavonia. The city statute of Osijek from 1698 adopted a provision that \"the tax and administrative documents, cash and city seal must be kept in a safe place.\" When Osijek became a free royal city in 1809, it modelled its archives after other cities. Other government bodies, the nobility, and the Church had archives, some of which are preserved today. The archives in Osijek included what was known then as the \"larger district of Osijek\", i.e., the present counties of Osijek-Baranja, Vukovar-Srijem, and Virovitica. A new chapter in the perception of archives as cultural heritage occurred after 1945. In 1947, the Ministry of Education established the Osijek branch of the State Archives in Zagreb. In 1957 a special archival sub-branch was founded, which collected, processed, and published important materials about the labour movement (Partijski arhiv), the Communist Party, and the partisan struggle during the Second World War. The archive was severely damaged during the war in 1991/1992, but was gradually repaired and resumed regular work. Because of the overwhelming needs of storing material and the lack of space in the central archive in Osijek, new archival collection centres were founded in the town of Vinkovci (1989) and Virovitica (1999). As of May 2009, the territorial jurisdiction of the State Archives in Osijek only extends to the territory of Osijek-Baranja County, as the newly formed National Archives in Vukovar began operating in January 2009 for their county, as did the State Archives in Virovitica in the same year, covering Virovitica county (all these are in the Slavonia region of Croatia).","generalContext":"Please note: most of the archival material on the Jewish community of what is today continental Croatia (Osijek and its broader region of Slavonija) is found in Belgrade's Jevrejski istorijski muzej (Jewish Historical Museum) in Serbia.

It was part of the Jasenovac cluster of concentration and death camps and of the wider Nazi-controlled genocidal effort across Europe.\r\n1 Prelude\r\n2 The camp\r\n\r\nIn the town of Sisak, situated near the town of Jasenovac, Ustaše presence was vigilant. Early in 1942, the local synagogue was robbed utterly, and the building later housed a worker's hall. The settlers of Sisak were quickly brought to Ustaše attention, and those of them that were of Serbian or Jewish kinship were tormented. \r\n\r\nThe camp\r\nThe camp held more than 6600 Serbian, Jewish and Roma children throughout World War II. The children, aged between 3 and 16, were housed in abandoned stables, ridden with filth and pests. Malnutrition and dysentery seriously impaired the children's health. They were fed daily with a portion of thin gruel and treated horribly by the Ustaše guards. \"Witnesses recount seeing an Ustasha soldier pick up a child by the legs and smash its head against a wall until it was dead, ...\"  The Red-Cross noticed the existence of the camp, and even tried to be of use and aid to the children, subsequently obtaining the release of some children, while others were poisoned with caustic soda later on. It is estimated that the death count was nearly 4,000.\r\n\r\n","mandates":"The area in which the Sisak State Archives performs its activities includes the area of the following present-day cities: Clay, Hrvatska Kostajnica, Kutina, Novska, Sisak, Petrinja, Ivanic Grad and the municipalities of: Donji Kukuruzari, Dvor, Hrvatska Dubica, Jasenovac, Križ, Lekenik, Majur, Martinska Ves, Popovaca, Sunja and Velika Ludina .","holdings":"The archival holdings of the State Archives in Sisak, which at present amounts to more than 800 record collections and other documentation, cover the period from 1565 up to today.","openingTimes":"The reading room is open Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[45.49118,16.37567]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"hr","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/hr-004544","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/hr-004544/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/hr"},"meta":{"subitems":2,"updated":"2019-08-22T08:43:57.451Z"}},{"id":"hr-004555","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Državni arhiv - odjel u Novoj Gradiški","parallelFormsOfName":["State Archives in Slavonski Brod - Department in Nova Gradiška"],"otherFormsOfName":["DASB-NG"],"address":{"streetAddress":"Trg kralja Tomislava 1","city":"Nova Gradiška","postalCode":"35400","country":"Croatia","countryCode":"HR","email":[],"telephone":["+385 (0)35 361 053"],"fax":[],"url":["http://www.dasb.hr/index.php/pregled-fondova/133-pregled-fondova-i-zbirki-nova-gradika","http://www.dasb.hr/index.php/pregled-maticnih-knjiga/98-brodsko-posavska-upanija/174-idovi"]},"generalContext":"The settlement of Jews in Nova Gradiska did not start until 1868 because of military restrictions, as it was a military base town in the Habsburg period.

Thanks to old Dubrovnik's respect for the written word, today the State Archive's repositories stretch back nearly a thousand years - to the beginning of the 11th century.\r\n\r\nAmong the most valuable of the archive's collections are those dating back to the time of the Dubrovnik Republic. The oldest original document kept in this collection dates from the year 1022. This is a papal bull of Pope Benedict VIII addressed to the then Archbishop of Dubrovnik, Vital. \r\n\r\nAs a community whose overall development was based not on war but rather on trade, Dubrovnik concluded several agreements on friendship and free trade with similar communes from the wider Adriatic cultural sphere in the 12th and 13th centuries. Along with these agreements, the archives preserve numerous charters of peace and trade with rulers and lords from the near and further Balkan hinterland, with whom Dubrovnik was often in conflict because of their threat to Dubrovnik’s small territory and free trade.\r\nThe growth in trade indirectly influenced the creation of the Dubrovnik archives. Notably, in 1278, the Dubrovnik authorities decided to establish a communal notary service in order to deal with the increasing number of commercial and other activities, which required written agreements. The Italian Tomasino de Saver was appointed as the first notary public was appointed. In their notary books, Tomasino and his successors diligently recorded trade and sales agreements, money lending certificates, marriage contracts, wills of Dubrovnik aristocrats and commoners; in short, everything that characterised daily life in the city. These notary books today allow us to look to trace and study the daily micro-life of Dubrovnik throughout the past centuries; to find out how certain jobs were performed; what was traded; who married whom; who was rich and who was poor; and much, much more. \r\n\r\nThe Statute of the City of Dubrovnik and the Customs statute from the late 13th century, various other legal books, and decisions of the Dubrovnik Council, which in continuity can be traced from 1301 until the French occupation and the fall of the Dubrovnik Republic in 1808, provide a wealth of data Dubrovnik's legal system and its relation to foreign rulers and states. In 1358, the supreme authority of Venice over Dubrovnik came to an end. From then until 1526, Dubrovnik recognised the Croatian-Hungarian king as its supreme sovereign, and over the following centuries it paid tribute to the mighty Ottoman sultans. Nevertheless, from the early 15th century, Dubrovnik can be rightfully called a republic – an independent, sovereign and internationally recognized state. Throughout the Mediterranean and Europe, the Dubrovnik Republic had consulates and other diplomatic missions in the courts of many foreign rulers for centuries. Numerous traces of contacts with these establishments – directions to deputies, letters to consuls, but also charters of various contemporary European and world statesmen, kings and emperors from Spain, the Vatican, Austria, Turkey, through to the rulers of Germany, France, England, all the way to Russia and the United States , are carefully stored in the Dubrovnik Archives. \r\n\r\nThe majority of the archived books and documents, especially those from the earlier period, were written in Latin , which was then the official diplomatic language, but there are numerous documents in Italian and Croatian, and Turkish (over 15,000 Turkish laws) and, to a lesser extent, Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Russian and Armenian.","buildings":"The Sponza Palace (Croatian: Palača Sponza), also called Divona (from dogana or 'customs'), is a 16th-century palace in Dubrovnik, Croatia, built in a mixed Gothic and Renaissance style. It was built between 1516 and 1522, and has served a variety of public functions, including as customs office, treasury, bank, mint and school. The palace became the cultural center of the Republic of Ragusa with the establishment of the Academia dei Concordi, a literary academy, in the 16th century. The palace's atrium served as a trading center and business meeting place. An inscription on an arch testifies to this public function:\r\n\r\nFallere nostra venant et falli pondera. Meque pondero cum merces ponderat ipse deus.\r\n\"Our weights do not permit cheating. When I measure goods, God measures with me.\"\r\n\r\nThe palace is now home to the city archives. The square on which the palace is located is used for the opening ceremony of the Dubrovnik Summer Festival.","holdings":"The total holdings of the State Archives in Dubrovnik, divided into just over 400 holdings and collections , occupy an area of over eight and a half kilometers, and the most valuable holdings, those of the Dubrovnik Republic, contain over 7,000 bound books and more than 100,000 independent documents . Also kept there are manuscripts and printed books of famous Dubrovnik scholars and writers (Gundulic, Palmotic, Getaldic, Boskovic - to name a few), as well as rich collections of old maps, photographs, postcards, newspapers, magazines and various plans and sketches.\r\n\r\nThe archival holdings of the Jewish Community in Dubrovnik were destroyed during the Second World War and most archival holdings related to the city's Jewish population or how it has been remembered refer to the post-war period. Mrs Radmila Šutalo is working on a PhD thesis that traces the history of Dubrovnik Jews (r.sutalo@gmail.com). \r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable artefacts is probably a school diary of Dubrovnik Jewish Elementary School, which dates back to the end of the 19th century.","openingTimes":"Monday to Friday from 8:15 a.m. to 3 p.m.\r\n<br />Saturday from 8:15 a.m. to 1 p.m.\r\n\r\nMaterial intended for use on the same day must be requested no later than 1:30 pm, and material intended for use on Saturdays must be ordered at least a day in advance.

Béatrice Godlewicz, a teacher who was completing an archivist degree at the time, also made the same observation. She set up a parallel association to that of Paris to provide for schools and teachers with films and information that dealt with Jewish themes that could combat stereotypes as well as Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism. From 1984 to 1988, Esther Hoffenberg, and later, Pauline Juste, allowed the Brussels association to develop compatible tools for recording data on the basis of cooperation and exchange of information. IMAJ – Paris was eventually integrated into Museum of Jewish Art and History, thereby losing its status as an independent association and the IMAJ name. IMAJ – Brussels, thanks to a grant from the Belgian French community remains an independent institution.\r\n\r\nThirty years on, IMAJ has achieved its goal: it has produce an ever-growing database of new films.

The latest research shows that Warsaw was probably founded near the estate of the Prince of Masovia in Jazdów between the 13th and 14th century. \r\n\r\nThe turning-point in the history of the city of Warsaw and the city Archives was included in the Polish Constitution of May 3rd, 1791. It was the law of crown towns and cities in the Polish Kingdom. The General City Archives of Warsaw were established in April 1792. The new institution was to preserve all municipal administration records. \r\n\r\nIn 1810 the Prince of Warsaw issued an edict which moved the oldest municipal records (c.a. 1800 vol.) to the Archives of Historical Records in Warsaw. In 1817 the remaining records were moved to the new City Hall building in the old Jabłonowski Palace located at today's Theater Square, close to the Old Town. The old, medieval building of the City Hall was demolished.\r\nIn October 1863, during the January Uprising, Polish underground militants burned the City Hall in order to destroy the records which could be dangerous when in hands of the Russian  administration. The building of the City Hall and a large part of the Archives was burned. Fortunately the oldest records were partly rescued by archivists who threw them out through the windows on the backyard. When the City Hall was reconstructed in 1864-1869, the Archives were moved to the Namiestnikowski Palace (now the Presidential Palace). In the reconstructed City Hall a special archival repository with 330 square meters of space was assigned. In 1893 the Archive preserved ca. 40 thousand volumes of records.\t\r\n\r\nJust before Poland regained independence new regulations for Warsaw municipal administration have been approved. In 1917 on the basis of these regulations the Main Archive of the Warsaw Municipal Administration was established. In 1938 the archive was transferred to the building of former Arsenal.\r\nThe most damage to the holdings was done during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. The records survived heavy fights, however just after the fighting was over the Nazi troops methodically burnt down all archival records kept in the Arsenal.\r\nIn the April 1945, after Warsaw was liberated, the Warsaw City Archives were brought back to life by the President of Warsaw. In the beginning the Archives occupied a few rooms at 8 Marszałkowska street. In 1955 the Archives received three reconstructed townhouses (7 and 9 Krzywe Koło street and 12 Nowomiejska street). For almost half a century now these buildings have been the main seat of the Archives. In June 1951 the Warsaw City Archives were incorporated in the structure of the state archives and received a new name - Voivodship State Archive. The scope of activity of the Archive changed, too, as it was now to cover the whole Warsaw Voivodship (Masovia region). In 1976, according to the reform of state administration, the archive was renamed the State Archive of the Capital City of Warsaw. Since 2013 the archive is named the State Archive in Warsaw.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see http://warszawa.ap.gov.pl/english/history.html","buildings":"Since 1955 the Archive is located in three reconstructed townhouses (7 and 9 Krzywe Koło street and 12 Nowomiejska street) in the Old Town quartier.","holdings":"The archival holdings of the State Archives in Warsaw (without the branches) contain 2901 archival fonds and collections, 1 162 926 archival units, 10 013.32 running meters (as for the end of 2005).

The State Archives also preserve registers from various churches, public registers, records of schools, educational institutions, courts, notary and private property records, private papers and private collections. Public register records which are kept in the State Archives are over 100 years old.\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of the Warsaw City Archives and their holdings in 1944, it was impossible to recreate the municipal administration records from 19th and 20th century (the oldest municipal administration records coming from up to the end of 19th century were preserved in the Archives of Historical Records in Warsaw). However, the missing records were replaced by new ones, some of them received as gifts.\r\nBecause of the loss of the most precious materials nowadays the most valuable records in the holdings of the State Archives of Warsaw are records of Russian Governor Administration in Warsaw, Warsaw Imperial University, Technical University of Warsaw, Russian Police in Warsaw and Russian Security Police (Ochrana) in Warsaw.\r\nThe historical materials include private property and notary records, among them last wills of famous people in the history of Poland, like for example Hugo Kołłątaj and Prince Józef Poniatowski. Over 2500 volumes of public register records contain information related to citizens of Warsaw and Masovia region. Also valuable is the collection of Warsaw maps and plans from 1762 to present times, with very interesting plans of Warsaw by Lindley.\r\n\r\nAfter World War II records of Commissary Mayor of Warsaw (1939-1944) were excavated from the ruins of the New City Hall.
