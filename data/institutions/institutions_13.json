One of the most prominent individuals in the Klaipėda region, Scheu was actively involved in the economic and cultural activities of East Prussia. Seeing how fast traditions and businesses were disappearing in the wake of the industrial revolution, he began collecting ethnographic and folkloric material of the Klaipėda region in two rooms of his manor house. Gradually, the manor museum built up a collection of ethnographic furniture, clothes, documents, prints and maps. In particular, it obtained many examples of old Lithuanian clothes and fabrics. This museum, the first of its kind in the region, was accessible to the intelligentsia and scientists.\r\n\r\nDuring the Second World War, the collections suffered from neglect, a situation which was compounded by the presence of Red Army units billeting in the manor. As the first manager of the museum collection post-1945 noted, ‘the majority of the exhibits have been knocked onto the floor and mixed with garbage…’. \r\n\r\nIn August 1948, the manor was given to the School of Horticulture and Beekeeping, which had originally been located in Kretinga. The museum was subsequently moved to a house in the center of Šilutė, Lietuvininkų str. 36. In 1949, it was reopened under a new name: Šilutė Local Lore Museum. M. Jonaitis, a teacher appointed as the director of the museum. At the time, the museum had 718 exhibits.\r\n\r\nBetween 1956 and 1961, the director of the museum was archaeologist J. Kvilonaitė. She focused on the archaeological monuments and renovation. The activities of the following director, D. Lukoševičiūtė-Narbutienė, greatly influenced the development of the museum's collections in 1961–1987; several expeditions were organized during which valuable household goods, fishing tools, agricultural implements and a number of prints were added to the museum’s collection. \r\n\r\nIn 1965, by the order of the Ministry of Culture, the Šilutė museum became a branch of the Klaipėda regional museum. The reorganisation did not benefit the museum. In 1972, the Klaipėda museum was subordinated to the Klaipėda Executive Committee and, eight years later, the Šilutė museum's main exhibitions were closed.\r\n\r\nWhen Lithuania declared its independence in 1990, the Šilutė county municipality re-established the museum. The Museum was renamed as the Šilutė museum. Changing the name of the institution also led to radical changes inside the museum; new exhibitions were prepared and the most valuable exhibits of Hugo Sheu's collection were once again put on display. \r\n\r\nThe museum went on to establish branches in Bitėnai, Švėkšna, Žemaičių Naumiestis and Macikai village.On 9 April 2015, the Šilutė museum changed its name into the Šilutė Hugo Sheu museum.\r\nOn 30 May 2015, the museum officially took up residence once again in the Šilokarčema manor.\r\n\r\nThe manor complex now includes a museum, a restoration and education center, where restoration workshops are established, and textile, metal and paper restorers are working, as well as an education classroom.

INA’s pioneering approach made France the worldwide reference in the field. 2004 was the year that INA  launched Inamediapro.com which is used by audiovisual professionals to conduct research, select and order archives. It facilitates access to the world’s largest audiovisual archive database.

The National Archives developed from the Senate Archives founded in 1816. The first Provincial Archives in Finland were established in the early decades of the 20th century. Finland was governed from Stockholm during the era of Swedish reign and was annexed to Russia in 1809 as an autonomous grand duchy with a separate Finnish central administration. Records concerning Finland were transferred from Sweden to the Senate Archives which eventually began receiving material from other offices. In 1869, the Senate Archives were renamed the State Archives, and then, in 1994, they became the National Archives.The establishment of Provincial Archives was proposed at the Diet of Finland already in 1888. However, the first Provincial Archives were founded only in 1927 in Hämeenlinna. The respective Provincial Archives of Oulu and Turku were established in 1932, Mikkeli (Vyborg) in 1934, and Vaasa in 1936. Two more Provincial Archives opened in Jyväskylä in 1967 and Joensuu in 1974.","mandates":"The task of Finland's National Archives is to ensure that documents belonging to the national cultural heritage are preserved and to promote their use for research.

The oldest document, a letter of protection given by King Birger to the women of Karelia, dates from 1316. The oldest continuous series of records, the accounts of the bailiffs (voudintilit), begin at the end of the 1530s. There are also series of accounts of the provincial administration, court records and land survey maps dating from the period when Finland was a part of the kingdom of Sweden. The most important sources from the period of autonomy are the large archives of the Senate, the State Secretariat and the Chancery of the Governor-General. \r\n\r\nThe National Archives accepts records older than 40 years to be stored permanently from state and central government agencies as well as district and local authorities operating in the Helsinki region. Around 10–15 per cent of the records of the public authorities are stored permanently. The National Archives also acquires private archives as donations or deposits. Private archives include papers of statesmen, politicians, influential people in society and culture as well as of ordinary citizens and different organisations. The copy collections are comprehensive and popular, especially the General List of Settlement in Finland and copies of historical parish records used by genealogists. Moreover, the National Archives has copies on microfilm of the records stored in the Provincial Archives, parish archives as well as foreign archives. The archival records older than about the turn of the 20th century of all Evangelical-Lutheran parishes in Finland are available on microfilm in the National Archives. Furthermore, the National Archives has a considerable number of maps and drawings, the oldest of which date from the 1650s. Computer data has also been transferred to the National Archives, the most comprehensive of which is the material transferred by the Population Register Centre.\r\n\r\nThe following archives in the custody of the National Archives are worth mentioning separately: transcribed records of the lower courts of justice from the 17th century; the archives of the Imperial Senate 1809–1918; the archives of central administrative boards from the beginning of the 19th century; supreme court archives since 1918; the archives of Porvoo Cathedral Chapter and several parishes in the Province of Uusimaa; the archives of the Defence Forces since 1918; records from the war years 1939–1945; the archives of all of Finland’s presidents except those of Urho Kekkonen and Martti Ahtisaari; the archives of the provincial government of Uusimaa from the 17th century; archives of district and local authorities in the Province of Uusimaa; government and ministerial archives dating back to 1918; the archives of the State Secretariat and the Chancery of the Governor-General 1809–1918; archives of the judicial administration in Old Finland, which belonged to the Russian empire in 1721–1812; Russian military records 1722–1918; accounts of bailiffs and administrative provinces 1537–1808; military records prior to 1809.

After 1850, the documents were moved several times and eventually wound up in a  building that later served as the municipal museum. \r\n\r\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the archive and the museum formed one facility. The then archivist K. Oberdorffer focused mainly on the professional storage of archival materials and the opening of the Most city fond, including the restoration of several books.  At the end of the Second World War, the most valuable materials were transferred to Milešov Chateau.\r\n\r\nThe archives and museum were split in the early 1950s. The District Archive in Most was officially established on 4 December 1953. As a result of the administrative reforms carried out in 1960, the Litvínov and Most District Archives were merged into one facility managed by the District National Committee in Most.\r\n\r\nDue to a lack of storage space for the archives, the city of Most acquired the first purpose-built archive building built in the Czech Republic after 1945. Its construction began in September 1979 and the grand opening took place in March 1984.\r\n\r\nAn amendment to the Archives Act saw the archives renamed as the State District Archives Most and, in 2002, it came under the responsibility of the State Regional Archive in in Litoměřice.

The term – archivum civile (municipal archive) – is first mentioned in an old document from 1635. The records coming from the Middle Ages say about eventful history of the town and indicate people of many nationalities and religious denominations living there. In the Kingdom of Poland and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Przemyśl was an important state and church administration centre. Since the moment of its definitive incorporation into Polish state in 80s of 14th century Przemyśl was the capital of Przemyśl Land (Ziemia Przemyska) in the Ruthenian Voivodship. In 15th century the court of the first instance, the land court, as well as the chamberlain’s court were established here. Catholic and Orthodox bishops had their seats in the town and after the Union of Brest the Orthodox bishop was replaced by the Grek-Catholic one. Both the hierarchs and the cloisters existing in the town had their own archives other than the municipal ones.\r\nThe period of two world wars did not result in any heavy damages of Old Polish documents. During the World War I the Przemyśl Archive has even got some acquisitions as the Committee of War Archive in Przemyśl subordinated to the Polish War Archive in Vienna was established in July 1916. This institution led by Tadeusz Troskolański gained printed matters, books, diaries and the press in Polish, Ukrainian and German informing about Polish question during World War I and the history of the besieged town-fortress Przemyśl. Unfortunately, the index of the war archive prepared by the archivist Maria Polaczkówna has not been preserved by now. The next trial of setting in order the Old Polish records has been undertaken in the times of II Polish Republic. The archivist Jan Smołka rearranged the municipal documents which resulted in the “Catalogue of the Archive of Old Records of Przemyśl” issued in 1927. During the War World II the Old Polish documents were taken out from the town twice; in 1940 they were brought to Lwów by the Soviet occupation authorities and came back to Przemyśl in 1943. The documents were evacuated again in 1944 by retreated German authorities to Tyniec near Cracow. They were regained only in 1947.\r\nDuring the War World II documents from the 19th century concerning the history of the town were stored in the municipal archive. \r\nIn 1950 the municipal archive passed under the state protection. According to the Enactment of the Minister of Education from November 10th 1950 The Voivodship State Archive in Rzeszów was established. The Archive of Przemyśl in June 1951 was included into the state archival net and subordinated to the Voivodship State Archive in Rzeszów. Since then it was known as Voivodshipl State Archive in Rzeszów Branch in Przemyśl. \r\nOne after the other the archives in Jasło (1952), Tarnobrzeg (1953), Sanok (1954), Przeworsk (1961) were established. In 1970 the seat of the Voivodship State Archive was moved to Rzeszów; in Przemyśl remained the County Branch of it. In 1976  according to the reform of state administration the Voivodship State Archive in Przemyśl was established. \r\nIn 1997 the co-operation agreement with the Central State Historical Archive in Lviv was signed; it allows to exchange scientific experiences and cooperate regarding the common publication allowing to reach easily the needed source of information.\r\nThe information about scientific, publishing and popularising activity of Przemyśl Archive is printed in annual report issued in the \"Rocznik Archiwalny\" periodical..","buildings":"After overhauling of the building done in the years 1992-1996 the State Archive in Przemyśl obtained the needed standard.

Its founders were the historian Salomon Hugo Lieben and the representative of the Czech-Jewish movement and city councillor August Stein. At the core of its collection were items from synagogues that had been demolished as a result of the clearance of the Prague Jewish ghetto at the beginning of the 20th century. \r\n\r\nThe Jewish Museum Association was abolished in the autumn of 1939 following the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia and the establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Its collection was taken over by the Prague Jewish community which, on the basis of an initiative from Karel Stein (head of the department for rural affairs), prompted the founding of the Central Jewish Museum in 1942. The Nazis approved of the project after lengthy negotiations, although they had completely different aims than the founders. Under the cover name 'museum', the Central Jewish Museum became a safe haven for liturgical objects, books and archival documents from the defunct Jewish communities for the duration of the war. Thanks to the efforts of the art historian and chief curator Josef Polák and his colleagues, this institution operated on a completely professional level, creating the basis for the work of the present-day museum.\r\n\r\nAfter the war, the museum was placed under national administration. The conditions laid down by the state meant that the Council of Jewish Religious Communities in Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia – as the legal successor to the disbanded Jewish communities – was unable to take effective control of the museum before the Communist coup of February 1948.\r\n\r\nIn 1950 the museum was nationalized, including its extensive collections. Its subsequent work was affected by ideological pressure, which considerably restricted the range of permissible topics and the way they could be dealt with. In addition, the Communist state made it impossible for the museum to develop its specialist research activities.\r\n\r\nThe museum's research did not resume until 1994, when its buildings were returned to the Prague Jewish community and the bulk of its collections were returned by the state to the Federation of Jewish Communities in the Czech Republic. On 1 October 1994 the museum regained its independence from the state, marking the start of a new chapter in its more than hundred-year history.\r\n\r\n*History of the Museum's Archives*\r\n\r\nA small collection of valuable older documents acquired through purchases or donations was put together by the Museum before the Second World War. Most of the archival records were transferred to the Museum during the war as part of the wartime shipment of material from the disbanded Jewish communities of Bohemia and Moravia. This is why, apart from individual documents, the Museum has few records from the archives of Jewish communities in the annexed border area. Materials from other communities, too, have not always been sufficiently preserved; in some cases, only fragments of documents have survived. For many years, the archives only contained material from a particular historical period with only a few preserved documents dating from after 1945. It was not until 2006 – having been transferred to a modern air-conditioned depository with ample space capacity – that the archives began to collect more recent material, in particular the extant records of Jewish communities that were re-established after the Second World War.","buildings":"The **Jewish Museum in Prague** and its **Shoah Documentation Department** are located at:\r\n\r\nU Staré školy 1\r\n<br />110 00 Prague 1\r\n\r\nThe Jewish Museum's **Archives**, however, are located in the Smíchov Synagogue Building at:\r\n\r\nStroupežnického 32\r\n<br />150 00 Prague 5\r\n\r\n","holdings":"The Archives of the Jewish Museum in Prague currently contain more than 600 linear metres of archival records. The main portion comprises the archives of the individual Jewish religious communities of Bohemia and Moravia. Also kept here are the holdings of certain Jewish associations and organizations, as well as personal papers. The archives also includes a small collection of patents, circulars, ordinances and decrees, a collection of seals and stamps, a collection of sheet music and a collection of miscellaneous items.\r\n\r\nThe archives also contain documents relating to individual Jewish communities, which contain photographs of synagogues, ghettoes and cemeteries, reports on surveys into these sites and references to literature and other sources on the history of Jewish settlement in specific areas.\r\n\r\nThe oldest document dates from 1454 (the Charter of Ladislaus the Posthumous). Archival materials that have been preserved in a systematic way, however, date from the mid-eighteenth century onwards.\r\n\r\nThe archives of individual Jewish communities in Bohemia and Moravia provide a valuable source for the history of the Jews in the Bohemian lands. The most important part of the archives is the Prague Jewish Religious Community collection. Among the most interesting items in the collection of personal papers are the T. Jakobovits, H. Flesch, S. H. Lieben and E. Kolben papers.\r\n\r\n*Archive of the Shoah Documentation Department*\r\n\r\nThe Shoah Documentation Department collects and makes available various materials on the history of the \"final solution of the Jewish question\" in Bohemia and Moravia. This section is responsible for the administration of the Terezín Archive Collection, which contains official documents associated with the activities of the Jewish Council of Elders and their offices in the Terezín ghetto, the estates of Terezín prisoners (literary works, music scores, theatre plays, diaries, albums, magazines) and personal narratives of Holocaust survivors. The second archive collection - Persecution Documents - contains various archive documents and estates from the Holocaust period, which did not originate in the Terezín ghetto, and personal narratives concerning the period of Nazi persecution. The work of this department also involves the administration of a photography collection from the Holocaust period and of a series of tape-recorded narratives of Holocaust survivors; the latter is an ongoing project that was launched in 1990. This section has at its disposal records - in the form of card indexes, registers and a special computer programme - of Holocaust victims from the territory of the former Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and of Jewish victims from Germany, Austria, Holland and Slovakia who passed through the Terezín ghetto. The Department also provides access to the collection of more than one thousand interviews with Holocaust survivors and to a new oral history collection on the life of Jews in post-WWII Czechoslovakia. A subsection of the Photo Collection related to the WWII is also taken care of here.\r\n\r\n","openingTimes":"**Museum**\r\n<br />Winter time 1 January–29 March 9 am–4.30 pm \r\n<br />Summer time 31 March–25 October 9 am–6 pm \r\n<br />Winter time 27 October–31 December 9 am–4.30 pm\r\n\r\nThe Museum is open every day except Saturdays and Jewish holidays.\r\n\r\nThe **Shoah Documentation Centre** is open on Monday and Wednesday from 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe **Archives'** reading room is open on Tuesday and Thursday from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.\r\n\r\n","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[50.09035,14.42112]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"cz","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/cz-002279","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/cz-002279/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/cz"},"meta":{"subitems":27,"updated":"2019-07-31T11:52:54.076Z"}},{"id":"pl-003068","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Archiwum Państwowe we Wrocławiu - Oddział w Kamieńcu Ząbkowickim","parallelFormsOfName":["The State Archive in Wrocław: The Kamieniec Ząbkowicki Branch"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Pl.

This is the expression of belief that no unlawful deeds of the state against its citizens can be protected by secrecy or forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe Institute of National Remembrance - Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation (IPN) has been established to fulfill the abovementioned mission.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the statute constituting the IPN, Communist crimes are understood as the deeds performed by officials of the Communist state in the period from September 17, 1939 to December 31, 1989, whose activities led to repress individuals and groups of people or to broke human rights in another ways. Crimes against humanity are understood mainly as crimes of genocide as defined by the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of December 9, 1948, as well as other forms of persecution and oppressions by official agents which were directed against people who belong to a given political, social, racial, religious or nation group. In accordance with the principles conveyed in the international law, no statutory limitation shall apply to war crimes, crimes against peace and crimes against humanity, whether committed in time of war or in time of peace, irrespectively of the date of their commission.\r\n\r\nThe IPN is responsible for gathering, assessing, disclosing and custody of the documentation created between July 22, 1944 and December 31, 1989 by Polish security agencies. The documentation would also include records regarding the Communist, Nazi and other crimes committed against Polish citizens in the period from September 1, 1939 to December 31, 1989, as well as political repressions carried out by officials of the former Polish investigative and justice organs in that time. The documentation concerning the activities of the security organs is also the subject of interest of the IPN.\r\n\r\nThe access to the IPN records is granted to foreigners on the basis of reciprocity.\r\n\r\nAnother major responsibility of the Institute is to investigate Communist and Nazi crimes as well as war crimes and crimes against humanity and peace. The IPN investigates crimes against people of Polish origin, as well as Polish citizens of other origin and other citizens who were harmed in the Polish territories.\r\n\r\nFinally, the IPN is in charge of public education and has been engaged in research regarding the 1939-1989 period, as well as dissemination of the research results in the form of publications, exhibitions, seminars, etc.\r\n\r\nThe activities performed by the IPN while fulfilling its mission must take into consideration the need to protect personal data of the repressed.","records":"According to the Act on the Institute of National Remembrance, the archives section of the Institute handles recording, acquisition/collection, safekeeping, compilation/elaboration, preservation, dissemination, and publication of documents, produced and accumulated by the state security authorities in the period from July 22, 1944 to July 31, 1990, as well as by the security apparatuses of the Third Reich and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. These documents concern the following issues:\r\n- Nazi crimes, Communist crimes, as well as other felonies comprising crimes against peace, humanity, or war crimes committed against people of Polish nationality or Polish citizens of other nationalities, in the period from September 1, 1939 to July 31, 1990;\r\n- Other political repression performed by the officers of the Polish law enforcement bodies or judicature, or persons acting on their order;\r\n- Activities of the state security authorities.\r\n\r\nThere are six departments in the IPN Archive:\r\n- Information and Checking Department\r\n- Archival Resources Management Department\r\n- Digital Resources Department\r\n- Dissemination Department\r\n- Current Service Department\r\n- Archival Research and Source Editing Department\r\n\r\nIn cities, where there are premises of courts of appeal, IPN Branches have been set up, in which there are Branch Archives (till 2016 Offices for the Preservation and Dissemination of Archival Records).

They made an immeasurable contribution to the development of economy, culture, health, trade and craft activities. The first doctor from Doboj was Simon Levi; Dr Rihard Skuteski founded the first choral society in Doboj in 1927, and his wife was the first nurse from Doboj. The first veterinarian mentioned in Doboj’s history was Leopold Kalc in 1920, while the brothers Pesah were Doboj traders who opened a department store. Jews were the owners of the first Doboj’s bank and printing press, which was led by Moric Trinki and the first lawyer in the city was Emil Rubinstein.\r\n\r\nNowdays, the Jewish Community in Doboj is small in number when compared to other religious communities, and part of its membership is made up of citizens of Jewish origin living in Teslic, Samac and Derventa. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, Jewish Community actively works to preserve the identity, religion, culture and traditions of its people, as well as developing good neighbourly relations with other peoples. In addition to preserving Jewish values, the Jewish community in Doboj aims to promote and maintain peace as well as cultural and economic cooperation among all the peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the Jewish contribution to a better life for the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish Municipality in Doboj strives to foster Jewish tradition and culture, but also to preserve monuments of Jewish culture and traces of life of Jews who are no longer in Doboj and the areas of nearby towns in the Republic of Srpska and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Community feels it has an obligation to support, as best it can, communities in the municipalities of Bijeljina, Brcko, Bosanski Brod, Vlasenica and Zvornik and the surrounding areas in cooperation with the Federation of Jewish Communities of Bosnia and Herzegovina.","conditions":"Researchers should establish contact with members of the Jewish Community before visiting the institution for research. Due to the small number of members, research services can only be provided on demand.

From its establishment in 1945 until 1993, the Museum remained thematically focused on the history of anti-fascism during World War II and the cultivation of socialist state values. The name of the Museum, once Museum of the Revolution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, has changed several times, but it has always been recognizable. After being renamed the History Museum in 1993, the thematic structure of the Museum also changed. Now the aim is to study the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the Middle Ages to present times.\r\n\r\nThe History Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a unique cultural institution in Bosnia and Herzegovina which has become a space for dialogue about the past and different aspects of remembrance. The museum develops different programs and activities in order to help visitors talk about the past, present, and future through its collections.","buildings":"The building of the History Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina was designed in 1959 by Boris Magaš, Edo Šmidihen, and Radovan Horvat. It is a unique example of the international style in architecture; its dominant cube forms and clean lines stand out in the panorama of the city of Sarajevo.\r\n\r\nProf. Stjepan Roš wrote about the uniqueness and the architectural values of the Museum:\r\n\r\n“The building of the Museum of the Revolution manifests  the pure architecture of Mies van der Rohe. It is constructed of “boxes,” transparent and full. The glass-lined breathable skeleton stretches on a white stone pedestal, on which rests a full stone box. The neoplastic structure has the effect of lightness and balance and is reminiscent of El Lissitzky Proun. Spaces are extroverted, clearly oriented towards the inner garden. Nine columns — slender trees — contradict their own actual function because it looks like they break through and do not support. Free placement of walls gives the impression of moving billboards and an “open free plan.”\r\n\r\n‘The exhibition rooms are cubic volumes that rise above an almost completely glazed ground,’ as he described the abstract, modernist building that is quite different from his later works.”","holdings":"The archival material the Museum has collected in previous decades has immeasurable value and importance for exhibits as well as for scientific research. It covers the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Although it has a valuable collection of manuscript materials from the period 1875 to 1941, the most significant and largest of the Museum's holdings are related to the period of World War II. Equally important is the material from the socialist period, which is becoming increasingly important for studies in the light of new research and current issues (such as the culture of memory).\r\n\r\nThe content of the collections can be divided into two main groups of documents: archival documents and various printed materials. The first comprises of letters; decrees; reports; letters; regulations; notes; diaries; and operational plans. The second group includes leaflets; posters; charters; certificates; paper money; postage and revenue stamps; periodicals; brochures; albums; atlases; and others.\r\n\r\nMaterial from the archive collection is particularly interesting for researchers who are dealing with the history of World War II as well as those who research the socialist period of Bosnian history. The complete structure of the Ustasha Surveillance Service, the most powerful police establishment of the Independent Croatian state during World War II, can be found in the collection and these materials have been used as standard source material for numerous scientific papers, doctoral theses, and publications of local and foreign researchers.\r\n\r\nThe collection of archival materials holds minutes and original decisions of the meetings of the First, Second, and Third ZAVNOBIH sessions (State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina), where the issue(s) of the organisation of Bosnia and Herzegovina within federal Yugoslavia was resolved in the period from 1943 to 1945. Even today, current slogans like: “Neither Serbian nor Croatian nor Muslim, but Serbian and Croatian and Muslim (Bosnia and Herzegovina),” as well as November 25, the date celebrated as Independence Day in the country, arise from these documents stored at the Museum.\r\n\r\nThe Museum has a complete series of stamps, extremely valuable philatelic sub-collections, as well as significant holdings of paper money from the Ottoman kaima to BAM (Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark). A large number of anti-Semitic posters, postcards, and letters from concentration camps are interesting material for exhibition in thematic museum exhibitions, some of them are from beyond the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The collection includes posters made by Ismar Mujezinović for the Olympic Games in Sarajevo in 1984.","openingTimes":"The Museum is open every day from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. ","conditions":"The museum material is classified in 8 museum collections and is available to scientific, cultural, and public researchers, students, and professors. The Museum is open for researchers every working day. Before starting research it is necessary to contact the head of the collection and complete a form in order to  access museum holdings.","accessibility":"The History Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina is located near the city center. Trams and buses stop near the museum, so it is easy to get to the museum from different parts. Public parking is available in front of the museum for a small fee. The museum is accessible to wheelchair users via a temporary ramp in front of the building. The museum is spread over two floors, but only the first floor is accessible to persons in wheelchairs. The museum provides a tactile area for people with visual difficulties. We are currently working on adapting the permanent museum displays for persons with visual and other disabilities. During the winter period the History Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina operates without heating.

The Canton Archives were founded by the City People's Committee in Tuzla on 1 July 1954, in accordance with the recommendation of the Executive Council of the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (NR BiH) No. 3768/53 of 24 January 1954. \r\n\r\nThe Archives of Tuzla Canton were founded as the Archives of Tuzla town, and started to supervise the region of northeast Bosnia which, since 1962 , includes 19 municipalities. Regional Archive jurisdiction was in force until 1992, when it stopped due to war circumstances, and the jurisdiction officially ceased to exist in 1995. The territorial jurisdiction of the present-day Archives of Tuzla Canton is related to the development of archival service in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was repeatedly adapted to the political-administrative organization of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Notably, in 1968, the Archives of Tuzla town's collection centre became part of the former Archives in Doboj. This integration came about mainly due to political reasons. Consequently, the Archives of Tuzla's area of jurisdiction was expanded to a total of 28 municipalities: Banovići, Bijeljina, Bosanski Samac, Bosanski Brod, Bratunac, Brčko, Derventa, Doboj, Gracanica, Gradacac,Kalesija, Kladanj, Lopare, Lukavac, Maglaj, Modrica, Odžak, Orašje, Srebrenica, Srebrenik,Sekovici, Teslic, Tesanj, Tuzla, Ugljevik, Vlasenica, Zvornik and Zivinice. This integration did not achieve the expected results and, as early at 1973, the single institution disintegrated into two: the Archives of Tuzla and Archives in Doboj. \r\n\r\nFrom then until 1992, the Archives of Tuzla had jurisdiction over 19 municipalities of northeast Bosnia: Banovici, Bijeljina, Bratunac, Brčko, Gracanica,Gradacac, Kalesija, Kladanj, Lopare, Lukavac, Orašje, Srebrenica Srebrenik, Sekovici, Tuzla, Ugljevik, Vlasenica, Zvornik and Zivinice. From 1977 to 1994, Archives of Tuzla has existed as \"Regional Historical Archive Tuzla\". Due to wartime circumstances and the establishment of the District Tuzla, the Archive was renamed the Historical Archive of Tuzla Canton, and therefore had authority over the creators and holders of current records in this area, which was under the control of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the war and after the signing of the Dayton Agreement in the Archive had jurisdiction over the creators and holders in the area of 13 municipalities of Tuzla Canton, which until 1999 belonged to the part of the municipality of Brčko, which significantly reduced the territorial jurisdiction of the Archives. For the development and operation of the Archives of Tuzla in the period after the war, i.e., after the signing of the Dayton Agreement, it was essential to adopt the Law on Archives of Tuzla Canton in 2000. According to the provisions of this Act, the Archive in 2002 re-registered as the Archives of Tuzla Canton, the name under which it operates today. Specific organisational changes through which the Archive went were the result of wider social trends, especially changes of a territorial-administrative nature.
