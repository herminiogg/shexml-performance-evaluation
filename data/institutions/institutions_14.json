The establisher's rights were taken over by the People's Committee of the County Banja Luka (Decision no. 2170 dated 29 June, 1956) with the consent of the People's Committee of the County Prijedor (Decision no. 1291 dated 15 February, 1956).\r\n \r\nDuring 1958, in the Local Community Office Nova Topola, an archival warehouse was established, in which the records collected on the territory of the County Bosanska Gradiska were deposited. Gradually, it became the Archival Collecting Center Bosanska Gradiska.\r\n \r\nIn a few years the Archives was developed into a respective institution whose depots had 250 archive groups and 9 archival collections of great importance for studying of social, political, economic, cultural and other conditions in the territory of northwest Bosnia.\r\n \r\nThe professional analysis of the collected records from the period 1878-1918, 1919-1941 and 1941-1945 was initiated. The majority of the records written in Turkish, German and Serbian language was stored in the building where the Archives had been placed - \"Banska uprava Vrbaske Banovine\" (i.e. the People's Committee of Banja Luka County). Unclassified records were taken over in the state they were found, without record on takeover. An Organized take over of the records started in 1961.\r\n \r\nThe development of the archival service, a great inflow of documentation and increasing awareness of the need to perform of archival activity throughout the whole territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1963 resulted in the establishment of the regional institution called the Archives of Bosanska Krajina with Head Office in Banja Luka.\r\n \r\nThe territorial and actual jurisdiction of the Bosnian Krajina archive covered the regions of Banjaluka and Bihać.\r\n \r\nThe Archives of Bosanska Krajina was still growing and new collective centers were formed in Prijedor (1 April, 1963), Jajce (1 February, 1964) and Bihac (15 April, 1964).\r\n \r\nThe collective centers accepted a great number of archive groups of the abolished county, municipality and community People's Committees.\r\n\r\nOn 1 January 1967, the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina took over from the counties the establisher's rights and financing of the activities of the Archives of Bosanska Krajina.\r\n \r\nThe great earthquake that struck Banja Luka on 27 October 1969 impeded the development of the archival service. Only by the middle of 1973 was a partial solution for the problem of record storage was found. The Archives together with the Museum of Bosanska Krajina were moved to the partly rebuilt \"Carska kuca\".\r\n \r\nAs of 1 January, 1974, after constitutional and territorial changes, responsibility for financing the Archives was taken over by 23 municipalities (Banja Luka, Bihac, Bosanska Dubica, Bosanska Gradiska, Bosansko Grahovo, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Bosanski Petrovac, Cazin, Celinac, Drvar, Jajce, Kljuc, Kotor Varos, Laktasi, Mrkonjic Grad, Prijedor, Prnjavor, Sanski Most, Skender Vakuf, Srbac, Sipovo and Velika Kladusa). These municipalities took over the establisher's rights from the Republic in 1976.\r\n \r\nIn 1981, the Archival Collecting Center in Bihac was abolished. The Historical Archives Bihac took over the responsibility for the protection of the records on the territories of the municipalities Bihac, Bosansko Grahovo, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Petrovac, Cazin and Velika Kladusa.\r\n\r\nDuring 1983 the Archival Collecting Centers in Prijedor and Jajce were abolished.\r\n \r\nThe armed conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1992-1995) had numerous negative consequences for archival activity. Until the middle of 1993 on the territory of the Republic of Srpska, the Archives of Bosanska Krajina with Head Office in Banja Luka, Regional Archives in Doboj and Regional Archives in Srbinje/Foca were active.\r\n \r\nBy the Act on Ministries (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Srpska\" no. 19/93), the Archives of the Republic of Srpska with Head Office in Banja Luka was established and had a status of an independent republic administrative organization.\r\n \r\nIt is consisted of the Archives of Bosanska Krajina in Banja Luka, Regional Archives Office in Doboj (established on 16 February 1954) and Regional Archives in Srbinje/Foca (established on 1 January 1976).\r\n \r\nBy the Article 40 of the Act on Ministries (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Srpska\" no. 19/93) the legal status of the Archives was changed again. Today it is a republic administrative organisation within the Ministry of Education and Culture, with real and territorial authority over the whole territory of the Republic of Srpska.","mandates":"By the Article 40 of the Act on Ministries (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Srpska\" no. 70/02) and the Article 37 of the Act on Archival Activity (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Srpska\" no. 35/99 and 9/00), the Archives carry out their activities across the whole territory of the Republic of Srpska.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the provision of the paragraph 2 Article 64 of the Act on Cultural Values (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Srpska\" no. 2/95), the Archives has a status of a central institution for the protection of cultural values.","administrativeStructure":"In the Archives of the Republic of Srpska, as a basic organsational unit, the following was formed:\r\n\r\n1\\) Section for classification and analysis of the records\r\n\r\n2\\) Section for supervision of the Registry Offices, legal and general affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Section for classification and analysis of the records is organised as follows:\r\n\r\n- Department for classification and analysis of the records\r\n\r\n  - Operations of depots and technical and technological protection of the records\r\n\r\n  - Information and documentation operations\r\n\r\n  - Operations of classification and analysis of the records\r\n\r\n  - Operations providing services to users and information diffusion\r\n\r\n  - Library operations\r\n    \r\n- Department for the research work and presentation of the records\r\n\r\n    - Operations of presentation of the records and publishing activity\r\n\r\n    - Scientific and research operations\r\n\r\n    - Operations of cultural, educational and information activity.\r\n\r\nWithin the Department for classification and analysis of the records, five regional units organised on the basis of the territorial principle are active:\r\n\r\n- **Regional unit in Doboj** (Vukosavlje, Derventa, Doboj, Modrica, Pelagicevo, Petrovo, Srpsko Orasje, Srpski Brod, Teslic and Samac)\r\n\r\n- **Regional unit in Zvornik** (Bijeljina, Vlasenica, Zvornik, Lopare, Milici, Osmaci, Srebrenica, Ugljevik and Sekovici)\r\n\r\n- **Regional unit in Foca** (Visegrad, Kalinovik, Rudo, Srbinje, Srpsko Gorazde and Cajnice)\r\n\r\n- **Regional unit in Istocno Sarajevo** (Bratunac, Pale, Rogatica, Sokolac, Srpska Ilidza, Stari Grad Srpsko Sarajevo, Srpsko Novo Sarajevo, Trnovo, and Han Pijesak)\r\n\r\n- **Regional unit in Trebinje** (Berkovici, Bileca, Gacko, Ljubinje, Nevesinje, Srpski Mostar and Trebinje)\r\n\r\n\r\nSection for supervision of the Registry Offices, legal and general affairs is organized as follows:\r\n\r\n- Department for protection of the records outside the Archives\r\n\r\n- Operations of Registry Offices supervision\r\n\r\n- Operations of giving expert help to the possessors of the Registry Office material\r\n\r\n- Department of legal and general affairs\r\n\r\n- General, legal and personnel affairs\r\n\r\n- Financial and accountancy affairs\r\n","buildings":"The main buidling is located in Banja Luka.

The recently modified Archives Law of 24 June 1955 (articles 5 and 6) and the royal decree of 12 December 1957 granted to the National Archivist and his delegates a power of supervision for the conservation of archives from all Belgian courts, tribunals,federal and provincial authorities and public institutions. Beside the archives from the central public institutions, the National Archives also preserve a large number of private archives such as personal archives that politicians have handed over to the State Archives. Numerous family archives–some of which are of considerable size–entrusted to the State Archives by Belgium’s most important families also add considerably to the richness of the Archives.

(Fondation Joseph Jacquemotte or FMM, was founded. The institute was concerned with political, economic and social training, studies and research on the history of the workers' movement. Its main objectives were to organise conferences on the history of the workers' movement and to publish books, brochures and theoretical journals (e. g. the Cahiers marxistes from 1969 onwards).\r\n\r\nIn 1971, the Jacquemotte Foundation extended its activities to the creation and custody of an archive and library. Consequently, the PCB entrusted its archives to the FJJ. The classification of the PCB archives was begun as well as the cataloguing of the library, which was enriched by the collection of the Bibliothèque populaire, which had ceased its activities.\r\n\r\nIn the 1980s, after having been one of the main sources of the Foundation's publications, the archives also began to serve as basic materials for historical exhibitions. Nevertheless, the archive remained relatively inaccessible to researchers as only certain fonds were accessible and consultations had to be arranged by appointment.\r\n\r\nFrom 1985 to 1986, under the scientific direction of José Gotovitch (Université Libre de Bruxelles) and Juul Verhelst (Archives générales du Royaume), three collections were sorted for the first time: the archives of the national congresses of the PCB-KPB (1919-1982); the library's books and brochures published in Belgium; and the directory of communist newspapers and magazines. The archives branch of the FJJ also took the opportunity to make the collections more accessible to students and researchers. \r\n\r\nAs of 1992, public access to the archives has been reassured. Moreover, a policy aiming at the preservation of fonds of organisations or private individuals has been put in place, which allowed the Centre to significantly increase its collections.\r\n\r\nIn 1994, the Council of the French Community adopted the proposal for a decree recognising private archival centres in the French Community of Belgium. It is within the framework of this new legislation that the FJJJ and its Centre des archives communistes en Belgique (CArCoB) submitted an application for recognition to the Community Government in May 1995. The recognition and grant agreement entered into force in 1996 and was renewable every three years. Since then, the archives – previously kept in the building where the central authorities of the former PCB-KPB, \"18-20, avenue de Stalingrad\" in Brussels, were located – have been housed in the former Maison de la Presse Communiste, at 33 rue de la Caserne, still in Brussels, where the editorial, administrative and printing staff of the daily Le Drapeau Rouge were located.\r\n\r\nOn 1 January 2001, CArCoB became an independent non-profit organisation. And since 1 January 2006, it has been contractually bound with the French Community of Belgium Wallonia-Brussels by a five-year agreement.\r\n\r\nCArCoB works in consultation and collaboration with its Flemish counterpart, Documentatie en Archief van de Communistische Beweging (DACOB).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","holdings":"In cooperation with its Flemish counterpart, the Dacob, the CArCoB manages the archives of the Communist Party of Belgium (1921-1989). It is also the repository of copies of documents relating to Belgium held in the archives of the Communist International in Moscow (RGASPI) as well as many of its activists' personal archives.\r\nThe CArCoB’s archives are divided into four distinct sections:\r\n•\tArchives of the Parti communiste de Belgique (PCB)\r\n•\tPCB-related organisations\r\n•\tOther Belgian communist movementsAutres mouvements communistes en Belgique\r\n•\tPersonal papers\r\nFor a more detailed overview of the subjects covered in each of these sections, see :\r\n\r\nhttp://www.carcob.eu/Archives-10\r\n\r\nThe Centre's library contains several thousand periodicals published by its organisations. It also holds thousands of valuable brochures from all the workers' organisations in Belgium, all the publications of the PCB and JCB and many editions of the Communist Parties around the world.\r\n\r\nIts poster and photo collections offer an overview of the struggles led by the PCB, the Communist Youth, the peace movement, cultural and social associations.","openingTimes":"Monday to Friday from 10 a.m to 4 p.m. \r\n\r\nBefore your first visit, it is advisable to contact the archivist by email, mail or telephone.","conditions":"The reading room is accessible to the public during CArCoB's opening hours or by appointment.

A group linked to the Consistory, chaired by Baron Jean Bloch, organised an exhibition about 150 years of Belgian Judaism. The success of that show led the organizers to create an art and history museum of the Belgian Judaism. \r\n\r\nThe association Pro Museo Judaico was established in 1981 with the first objective to preserve and promoting the socio-cultural heritage of the Jewish community in Belgium and to collection of evidence of its past. In 1989 a team of researchers settled in at 74 Avenue de Stalingrad, above the Beth Israel synagogue. They introduced thirty exhibitions in parallel with the permanent exhibition. In 1999, the Belgian government conceded the Jewish Museum a group of buildings near the Sablon. The Museum was established in 2005 at 21 rue des Minimes in a spacious building in the heart of the historic district of the capital.","holdings":"The Jewish Museum of Belgium’s Archive manages nearly 300 linear metres of documents.

The \"Register of Jews\", deposited in the Museum by the Jewish Social Service, warrants particular attention: its 45,000 records have been digitised by the former Jewish Museum of Deportation and Resistance (now Kazerne Dossin) in Mechelen and a database allows users to easily search through the 56,000 registered people.","openingTimes":"The MJB is open on Tuesday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.\r\n","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[50.84077,4.35337]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"be","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-002122","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-002122/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be"},"meta":{"subitems":38,"updated":"2019-07-26T08:15:32.430Z"}},{"id":"be-002136","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Openbaar Centrum Voor Maatschappelijk van Brussel, Dienst Archieven en Museum / Centre Public d'Action Sociale de la Ville de Bruxelles, Service Archives et Musée","parallelFormsOfName":["CPAS of Brussels, Department of Archives and Museum","CPAS Bruxelles, Service Archives et Musée","OCMW Brussels, Dienst Archieven en Museum","Public Centre for Social Welfare of Brussels, Department of Archives and Museum"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Rue Haute 298a / Hoogstraat 298a ","city":"Brussels","postalCode":"1000","country":"Belgium","countryCode":"BE","email":["archives@cpasbxl.brussels","bibliotheques@cpasbxl.brussels"],"telephone":["+32 2 543 60 55"],"fax":[],"url":["http://ocmwbxl.brussels/","http://cpasbxl.brussels/"]},"history":"The Public Centre for Social Welfare dates back to the end of the 18th century. Due to the centralisation efforts of French regime, the various Brussels relief institutions were grouped together within the General Council of Hospices and Aid. As a result, their assets were transferred to the Council. Paintings, sculptures, jewellery etc. from the former religious foundations, hospices, hospitals and a Beguine convent were entrusted to the new administration in charge of organising public assistance.\r\n\r\nAt first, the collection of assets were kept in the administration's premises in the former Bogard convent, rue du Midi (now the Academy of Fine Arts of the City of Brussels). In 1843, the collection was moved to the headquarters of the Conseil des Hospices to the site of Saint-Jean Hospital, on Boulevard du Jardin Botanique. A tiny part of the collection was on display there, notably in the monumental chapel.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the 20th century, the Hospice Council – which would become the Social Welfare Commission in 1925 – began to display its collection more openly. A first presentation of Brussels' artworks was organised in 1921 at the Museum of Ancient Art. Quite quickly a small museum was established under the direction of the Archivist Paul Bonenfant in the administration offices and in the chapel. Inaugurated on 26 April 1927, in the presence of Mayor Adolphe Max, it is one of the oldest museums in Belgium. In 1935, the administration relocated to rue Haute and the collection was transferred along with it, where it has remained ever since. \r\n\r\n","mandates":"The Public Centre for Social Welfare is a public institution provided by the municipalities in Belgium. The term is a translation of the Dutch Openbaar centrum voor maatschappelijk welzijn (OCMW), French Centre public d'action sociale (CPAS) and German Öffentliches Sozialhilfezentrum (ÖSHZ).\r\n\r\nEach municipality has, besides a municipal council, a separate OCMW/CPAS council. The fact that OCMW/CPAS is a separate institution from the municipality itself, is historical, whereas in other countries such social services are given by the municipalities themselves. Examples of social services provided by the OCMW/CPAS include financial help, medical help, housing, legal advice, etc. ","holdings":"For the *Ancien Régime*, the archives of the former hospitals (Fonds H) and charitable institutions (Fonds B) are divided into charters, maps, censors, account registers and atlases. These documents make it possible to reconstruct the history of these charitable institutions in the first place, but they also provide extremely valuable information on the history of Brussels in general.\r\n\r\nThe collection of Found and Abandoned Children, whose series of minutes dates back to 1685, is of particular interest to professional and amateur genealogists.\r\n\r\nThe archives of the Hospices and Aid administration (1796-1925) are made up of several series, organised under various departments such as Board of Directors Properties, Works, Personnel, Finance,  Litigation.

It gathered also records from the municipal archives of Poznań and other towns of Poznań province. In 1884 it was transferred to the new building edified for the archival purposes on Przemysł Mound. In 1919 it was taken over by Polish authorities and renamed the State Archive in Poznan. During the German occupation the archive became Reichsarchiv Wartheland Posen. The German authorities transferred the Municipal Archive, created in 1935, from its seat at Wolnica square to the building of the Jewish Community at Stawna street. They excluded the Poznań municipal records from Reichsarchiv and transferred them to the building of former pawnshop at Sieroca street. The oldest and most valuable documents were hidden in various localities in Germany.  In January 1945 the archival building on Przemysł Mound burnt down during the military operations with all its holdings (about 320 000 units). \r\nIn 1945 the Polish State Archive in Poznań was reactivated in the building of former Imperial Castle. It consisted of records repatriated from Germany or collected in various localities of Greater Poland. In 1951 the Municipal Archive, located at Sieroca and Stawna street, was united again with the State Archive.

Since 1953 this archive was subordinate to Wojewódzkie Archiwum Państwowe in Warsaw. In the period 1964 –1976 it was a branch of Archiwum Państwowe miasta Stołecznego Warszawy and was called Oddział Terenowy.\r\nIn 1975 as a result of a general change of territorial division of the country, Siedlce became a capital of the newly born voivodship. A year later  “Oddział Terenowy” was changed into Wojewódzkie Archiwum Państwowe w Siedlcach. In 1983 another change brought a contemporary name: Archiwum Państwowe w Siedlcach [The State Archive in Siedlce].\r\nMore information on the history of the archive: https://www.siedlce.ap.gov.pl/p,63,historia-archiwum","holdings":"Records at the archives cover the following geographic area:\r\nLublin voivodship - counties: Łuków, Ryki (Kłoczew municipality); Mazowsze voivodship -counties: Siedlce, Garwolin, Sokołów Podlaski, Węgrów, Mińsk Mazowiecki (municipalities: Cegłów, Dębe Wielkie, Dobre, Jakubów, Kałuszyn, Latowicz, Mrozy, Siennica, Stanisławów; county Otwock (municipalities: Kołbiel, Osieck, Sobienie Jeziory); county Wołomin (municipalities: Jadów, Poświętne, Strachówka).\r\n\r\nChronologically the record span from 1604 until 2005.\r\n\r\nOn 30 November 2011 the archive contained 1.701 archival funds (3.472 running meters; 510.031 archival units. \r\n\r\nCollections of archival resources in the State Archive in Siedlce come mainly from the 19th and 20th centuries.\r\n\r\nThe records in the State Archive in  Siedlce can be divided into five main groups.\r\n1) Documents of lower and higher law courts from the period 1865 – 1998. The most numerous is Sąd  Okręgowy w Siedlcach [The Province Court] and courts of conciliation from various counties of Siedlce gubernia (governorship), municipal courts, district courts and public prosecutor’s offices. This records can give full perspective into social conflicts, their character and range.\r\n\r\n2) Land records from the period 1810 – 2001 include 15.319 archival units. They are mainly mortgage books, each of them concerning the particular land property. They come from land registries in Garwolin, Łuków, Mińsk Mazowiecki, Siedlce, Sokołów Podlaski and Węgrów and cover the territory of previous Województwo Podlaskie [Podlasie Voivodship], created in 1815. The files present the financial state of land properties, sometimes they contain detailed descriptions of manor belongings, borders and maps.\r\n\r\n3) Notary records of various notary’s offices from the period 1810 – 1951 contain notarial deeds connected to sales contracts, agreements, last wills, premaritals. Their territorial range covers countties of Garwolin, Łuków, Siedlce, Sokołów Podlaski and Węgrów.\r\n\r\n4) Civil state records are the most numerous group among the archival collections. They present 210 parishes or religious communities living in the territory of  the Siedlce gubernia and span the years 1810 – 1909. Initially (1810 – 1825) civil state records were kept and stored by local governments, then since 1826 they were kept by parishes. The State Archive in Siedlce possesses records from:\r\n- 101 Roman – Catholic parishes; 23 Jewish communities; 14 Greek – Catholic parishes (1826 – 1875); 12 Orthodox parishes (1837 – 1909);\r\n- 2 Evangelical parishes (1832 – 1909); 3 Mariavite parishes ;1 Protestant parish.\r\nThe books contain births, marriages and deaths records which make the basic resource for genealogical research.\r\n\r\n5) About 30 % of the archival collections come from administrative bodies of various ranks (city councils, local governments and self – governments, county authorities, voivodship authorities) and various counties: Łuków, Garwolin, Mińsk Mazowiecki, Siedlce, Sokołów Podlaski and Węgrów and span the period 1804 – 1998. These funds present almost all fields of social, political, economical and cultural activity in the region. Unfortunately the documents before 1945 are not numerous, but collections after 1945 are exhaustive.\r\n\r\nDocuments from the Second World War are exceptionally scanty. The most meaningful of them is the collection of announcements issued by German police in Warsaw and Lublin and concerning the inhabitants of Siedlce, Sokołów, Węgrów and Łuków counties\r\n\r\nThe collection of old postcards and photographs is worth of attention. The old postcards show Siedlce in the turn of 19th and 20th centuries, buildings which do not exist now, historical monuments and present the ways the city has changed. In the photographs prominent people, important events, industrial objects and housing estates are commemorated.\r\n\r\nThe cartographic collection contains maps of granges (1826 – 1924) from the Siedlce county. (Another collection of that kind is included in mortgage books). The plans show not only manor houses, parks and gardens, grange buildings, but also point kinds of agricultural cultivations and their acreage. Another important collection here are “Maps of Siedlce” prepared and made before the Second World War by the geodesist named Wejchert. They show the urban development between the world wars and many non-existing buildings.\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that the significant part of documents produced in Siedlce institutions during the last two centuries is now kept in the State Archive in Lublin. The most valuable among them are: Urząd Cyrkularny Siedlecki (1797 – 1809) which covers documents from the period of Austrian partition on the territory of Siedlce; Prefektura Departamentu Siedleckiego [Prefect’s Office] (1810 –1814) and Komisja Województwa Podlaskiego [the Government of Podlasie Voivodship] (1816 – 1837) present Siedlce in the times of the Warsaw Duchy and the Kingdom of Poland. In the Lublin Archive many funds from the period of functioning gubernia in Siedlce are kept, such as Rząd Gubernialny Podlaski [Government of Gubernia in Siedlce] (1837 – 1844), then Rząd Gubernialny Siedlecki (1867 – 1912) and Kancelaria Gubernatora Siedleckiego [Governor’s Office in Siedlce] (1866-1913), Urząd Gubernialny Siedlecki do Spraw Stowarzyszeń [Gubernia Office on Controlling the Associations] (1906-1915).\r\n\r\nDue to numerous changes in territorial and administrative divisions and changes in territorial range of the Siedlce archive as well, many documents are stored in other archives:\r\n- the State Archive in Lublin – the Branch in Radzyń Podlaski possesses the files from county of Łuków;\r\n- the State Archive in Warsaw – the Branch in Otwock possesses the files from counties of Garwolin and Mińsk Mazowiecki.","openingTimes":"Monday - Wednesday to Friday. 8.30-15.00, Thursday  11.45-17.45.\r\nThe reading / research room opening hours: Mon., Tue., Wed., Fri. – 8.00 – 16.00; Thu. – 11.45 – 17.45.","conditions":"The documents are available in original form or in copies in the archival research room.\r\n\r\nMaking research in the research / reading room is free.\r\n\r\nThe users can apply for sending them a reproduction of the documents they need or information about their content.\r\n\r\nThe archival staff can prepare or complete for users an archival research connected to social, genealogical or ownership matters to legal or administrative purposes.

When the University was established\r\nby Count Eberhard the Bearded [Graf Eberhard im Bart] in\r\n1477 with papal permission, the new body was granted a\r\nnumber of important privileges such as self-administration,\r\ntax exemptions and autonomous jurisdiction. The\r\ndocuments containing the grants or confirmations of these\r\nprivileges by subsequent rulers of the Duchy of Württemberg,\r\nwhich were of vital importance to the University's\r\nacademic freedom and its independence from city and\r\nprovincial authorities, were secured along with other valuables\r\n(such as the silver treasure [Silberschatz] and cash\r\nassets) first in the vestry of the St. George's Collegiate\r\nChurch in Tübingen, an then, beginning in 1549, in a vault\r\nunder the Main Assembly Hall [Alte Aula]. By the mid\r\neighteen hundreds, however, these documents had lost\r\ntheir original importance, since the University hade been\r\ncompletely reorganized and stripped of its traditional\r\nprivileges during the Napoleonic era and the years\r\nthereafter. Therefore in 1865 the Senate, in order to make\r\narchival materials more easily accessible to historians,\r\nturned over the old Archives and most other University\r\nrecords originating prior to 1750 to the Library. The\r\nArchives formed a separate section within the Library's\r\nmanuscript collection until they were placed under the\r\ncontrol of a professional archivist in 1967. This was done\r\nas part of the preparations for the upcoming 500th\r\nanniversary celebrations, but was also motivated by the\r\nrapidly expanding amount of non-current records\r\nthroughout the University. Today the holdings amount to\r\napprox. 4.800 linear metres.\r\n(Source: http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/einrichtungen/universitaetsbibliothek/universitaetsarchiv.html)","openingTimes":"Service facilities: Monday – Friday 9:00-12:00 and 14:00-\r\n16:00.\r\nHistorical reading room [Handschriftenlesesaal] in the Bonatz-\r\nBau of the Library: Monday – Friday 9:00-18:00.","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[48.52489,9.06023]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"de","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de-002700","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de-002700/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de"},"meta":{"subitems":1,"updated":"2019-07-15T09:53:20.300Z"}},{"id":"al-006014","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Drejtoria e Përgjithshme e Arkivave","parallelFormsOfName":["The General Directorate of Archives of the Republic of Albania","DPA"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Rruga “Jordan Misja” ","city":"Tirana","postalCode":"8303","country":"Albania","countryCode":"AL","email":["dpa@albarchive.gov.al"],"telephone":["+355 4 4541798"],"fax":[],"url":["http://albarchive.gov.al/"]},"history":"The General Directorate of Archives is the most important archival institution in the country, in which place are collected, preserved, managed, and served important records that witness about the history of the nation and Albanian State.

Due to the socio-historical circumstances, wars and the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, these museums became a burden, unwanted witnesses of the past, traces of which were being thoroughly erased from the present. The funds of these two institutions served as the basis on which, according to a political decision, the new museum was established. Even though this musealization of Yugoslavia was supposed to “put it on the shelf” in accordance with the understanding of a museum as a storage place for “old and unnecessary things”, it turned out that the collections, histories, documentation and employees of these two institutions became the basis of a twenty years long search for ways of acknowledging Yugoslavia as a heritage.\r\n","administrativeStructure":"The Museum has different sections.The principa are the Department of fund research and preservation and the Library fund.\r\n","records":"Collection of the Museum of Yugoslavia was created by inheriting the funds of the Memorial Center “Josip Broz Tito” and the Museum of the Revolution of Nations and Nationalities of Yugoslavia, as well as by two decades of work on the extension of the Museum fund, that has resulted in numerous acquisitions.

It was founded in 1826, in Pest, together with the foundation of the Matica Srpska Literary Society. It was only natural for the books to find their place in such a literary society. The intention of the founders, led by Jovan Hadzic was „to develop the literature and the education of the Serbian people, i.e. to publish Serbian books and publicize them\". The first issues of Letopis Matice srpske, which appeared in 1824, first book editions and gifts from Russia, as well as other books unknown to us, were the core of the Matica Srpska Library. It was officially opened for its readers on 26 August, 1838 „for the Slavonic people of any language or origin, who are welcome to enter and read the books\". It was situated in Tekelijanum, the institute supporting Serbian students in Pest. This Institute was founded by Sava Tekelija, the president and patron of Matica SrpskaThe Library received its first known gift from Atanasije Stojkovic in 1832. In the same year, it began to exchange books with the Russian Academy of Science. From April 1839, the Library received more and more books. The first large personal libraries were received from Platon Atanackovic and Sava Tekelija. The Matica Srpska Library was already known as the largest Serbian library. A lot of other people also donated books at that time: Teodor Pavlovic, Dimitrije Tirol, Vuk Karadzic, Petar II Petrovic Njegos, Jovan Subotic, Jan Kolar and others.\r\n\r\nIn the period from 1848 to 1849 both the Library and Matica Srpska were closed.\r\n\r\nIn 1864, the Library and the Society were moved to Novi Sad, where they continued their successful development. In that period, the stock of the library was increased through purchases, subscriptions and, especially, through exchange of the Matica Srpska publications for publications of the academies of science, universities, literary and cultural societies and journal publishers from all Slavonic and most European countries, as well as through the purchase or donation of private libraries, libraries of different institutions and societies.\r\n\r\nThe Library was professionally organized in 1842-1843 by writer Jovan Subotic. He prepared and published the first Serbian current bibliography in Letopis Matice srpske (1842-1847).\r\n\r\nJovan Djordjevic, a man of literature and the theatre, as well as the Matica Srpska secretary from 1857 to 1859, was the first to suggest a concept according to which the Matica Srpska Library should become a national library. He proposed that all Serbian books and periodicals, Slavonic books and all publications about the Serbian people should be collected. He also proposed that university library should be founded in Tekelianum.\r\n\r\nJovan Radonic, historian, was the librarian from 1899 to 1905 and in The Library Rules, he established the principles of planned acquisition, the protection and usage of books and periodicals, and gave the basic principles for setting up a catalogue.\r\n\r\nBetween the two World Wars, the Matica Srpska Library continued its activities as a public and scientific library. As a public library, its intentions were always to make the books as accessible to the readers as possible. As a scientific library, it provided resources that served for studies on Vojvodina, which was the aim of the Matica Srpska Society. The universal character of its collections, the successful exchange with Yugoslav and foreign libraries, as well as the needs of scientists from Novi Sad and other Yugoslav centers, encouraged the development of its functions as a general scientific library.\r\n\r\nDuring both World Wars, the Library was closed and its stocks, fortunately, remained almost untouched.\r\n\r\nAfter the Second World War, the Library underwent intensive development in various directions. In 1948 the Matica Srpska Library became the Central Library of Vojvodina and started to receive a sample copy of all the publications in Serbia, and in 1965 all of Yugoslavia. It became an independent institution in 1958. Ever since the University of Novi Sad was founded (1960), the Library has contributed to the development of research work at the University by practically functioning as a university library as well. From 1948 to 1994, it was the central library for all the libraries in Vojvodina and after that, for all the academic and scientific libraries. In accordance to the Law on Library Work (1994), the National Library of Serbia cooperates with the Matica Srpska Library in the realization of the general interests of library activities in the Republic.\r\n\r\nSince 2003 the Matica Srpska Library has started again to be the central library for all the libraries in Vojvodina organizing expert exams for librarians as well.\r\n\r\nWith its rich collections offering excellent opportunities for cultural, historical and scientific research, and the variety of library and information services, the Matica Srpska Library is a modern library of Yugoslav significance. Its long and continuing existence places the Matica Srpska Library among the institutions of the Serbian people with the longest tradition.","administrativeStructure":"Departments of the Matica Srpska Library:\r\n- Department of Old and Rare Books and Legacies\r\n- Acquisition and Exchange Department\r\n- Department for Cataloguing and Bibliographic work\r\n- Department for Storage and Use of Publications\r\n- Department for PReservation of Publications\r\n- The Research and Development Department\r\n- Administrative Department\r\n- Financial Department","records":"The Library receives the sample copy of all the publications of Serbia.\r\nThe legacies and the donated libraries both of individuals and institutions are preserved as the special collections.\r\nThe Library exchanges publications with 320 foreign libraries and institutions.\r\nCataloguing and bibliography work are automated since 1989.","buildings":"The Library is situated in the Matica Srpska building but some of its collections have been temporarily stored in an adapted old storehouse.

It was created as a special depository of books, then as a library within the Ministry of Education, and since then the library gathered many libraries, public and state authorities and bought out several private libraries ( Lukijan Mušicki, Josip Schlesinger), which have grown over time into the National Library.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, the library had 1421 titles in 2283 volumes and an authors` catalogue, developed by Milovan Spasić, Ph.D. By the order of the Prince in 1853, the profession of State Librarian was introduced, in the rank of a high school professor. The name of the “National Library” was established by Djura Daničić, who defined the national conception of the purchasing policy and began compiling the current national bibliography. Stojan Novaković was the first legislator of the Library. By his merit, and through the Press Law of 1870, the privilege of legal deposit was established, and the Library was separated from the Ministry of Education and Church Business at which time the publishing activity started. More laws regarding the National Library were promulgated during that period, up to 1901. These are the Serbian Royal Academy of Sciences Act, which gave the right to the Academy to supervise the work of the Library, hence the National Library Act, which defined the main tasks of the Library as: a) to aid the development of science in Serbia, b) to facilitate the spread of mass education and c) to handle the Serbian bibliography. At that time, the Library received the first regulation of its internal organization and work.\r\nThe First World War brought a lot of misfortune to the Library. The bombing destroyed a part of its holdings, and the remaining collections were moved for safety to several different places in Belgrade, Niš and Kosovska Mitrovica. A part of the collections ended up in Sofia, but was returned after the war. A lot of the library materials, manuscripts, books and newspapers disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe Press Law and the new National Library Act from 1919 provided the Library with the status of the central state library and the right to acquire an obligatory copy from the entire territory of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The compilation of the current bibliography of Yugoslavia began in 1928. The international format of the catalogue card was adopted in the Library in 1938. The journal of the National Library, “The Herald”, began with issue in 1940. \r\n\r\nDuring the Second World War, on April 6th 1941, during the bombing of Belgrade, the complete library was burnt to the ground. A great part of the holdings, catalogues and inventory, were destroyed at that time. The reconstruction of the library holdings began during the war, and was intensified after the war. \r\n\r\nThe Library acquired new, arranged catalogues, so that in 1947 the Author Catalogue and in 1948 the Subject Catalogue were developed. In 1953, the Library Center was founded, which grew into the Department of Development and Research of the Library and Information Science. The Bibliographical Department was founded in 1960, with the aim of compiling the Serbian retrospective bibliography, and in the same year the Archeographical Department was founded with the purpose of describing and registering the South Slavic Cyrillic manuscripts, and reconstructing the manuscript collection. At that time, the Conservation laboratory was created for the protection of the library’s material as well as for scientific and experimental research on books and papers.\r\n\r\nBy the Serbian Libraries Act from 1965, the National Library, as the central parent library in Serbia, was given a special position and many important functions. \r\n\r\nOn the anniversary of the bombing destruction, April 6th 1973, the Library solemnly opened the doors of its new building, where it is still situated today. Following year, in 1974, the Specialized Catalogue was formed, according to the UDC, then the Central Catalogue of Serbia and the Center for Scientific Information were established too. In 1976, the Library adopted the new regulations of cataloguing and switched to a new, international standard of bibliographic description - the ISBD. Preparations were made for switching to automatic data processing. \r\n\r\nThe Library had started with the cataloguing of publications before printing in 1987, making the cataloguing records for the monographs in publication, the CIP – Cataloguing in Publication, including a majority of editions in the country. The computerized catalogue of the National Library of Serbia was established in 1989. Since the catalogue included the entire newly acquired material, in 1991, it suspended the making of the card catalogues.\r\nIn 1996, the Library obtained its local computer library network, when the access to Internet was facilitated and the first web site presentation of the National Library of Serbia was made. \r\nSince 2000, the Library has made important steps, in the first place regarding its opening towards the world, whereby the Center for International Cooperation received a more intensive and important role. The Center for Scientific Information initiated the foundation of the Consortium of Libraries in Serbia for common acquisition (KoBSON), which facilitated access to the huge foreign electronic databases and journals, with over 13.000 online titles. A great number of projects have been launched. One of them is the foundation of the Center of the Virtual Library of Serbia (VLS), which connects the electronic catalogues of all libraries in Serbia in an unique shared electronic catalogue.","buildings":"The foundations of the building of the National Library were laid on October 20th, 1966.

Three elementary groups are noticeable: the depository, the reading area and the working area. In accordance with the above mentioned settings, the complex is divided on a functional basis, structurally and artistically into two basic sets joined by a link. \r\n\r\nThe building of the National Library is an unavoidable edifice on the Belgrade map, because of the importance of the institution regarding national culture and because of its tranquility, rhythm and measures reflected in its architectural solution, bringing about the echo of tradition and calling the passers-by under its huge roof.","holdings":"The National Library has several collections:\r\n- Old and rare books\r\n- Literary and other Manuscripts and Archival\r\n- Cartographic Materials\r\n- Music and Sound\r\n- Funds of Photographic documents\r\n- Engravings and Art Material\r\n- Posters and Small Documentary Material\r\n- Memorial Libraries and Legacies\r\n- Serials","openingTimes":"Working Days 08 - 21 h\r\nSaturday 08 - 15 h\r\nSunday closed","conditions":"Free access.

It was yet another manifestation of celebrating Serbia's Independence. First permanent display was opened in 1904 according to 100th Anniversary of First Serbian Uprising and as a part of King Petar's Coronation Ceremonies.\r\nMuseum was then placed in a humble building from Turkish period, just beside the Roman Well. Soon after the foundation, Museum has entered the Europe by participating on the Balkan Expo in London in 1907. There, with around 100 carefully chosen objects, Museum had attracted the attention of London public and it was described in local newspapers.\r\n \r\nMuseum’s building was demolished in First World War, and collections were mostly destroyed or were seized by occupation troops. Again more than two decades had past before the new Display has been opened. King Aleksandar I Karadjordjević issued a Decree of Founding the Military Museum in Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Brigadier Vojislav Vuković, majordom of Royal Court became a director of Military Museum. Systematical collecting of objects started and numerous donors, former soldiers and their descendants responded. Their names were signed in a special „Golden Book“, work of a famous Russian artist Vsevolod Guljevič. The book is still being kept in the Military Museum.\r\nNew permanent Display was opened in 1937 in two buildings of which one is today a residence of City Bureau for Preserving of Monuments.\r\nDuring the Second World War collections suffered new devastation. However, according to the program of occupation troops, some cultural institutions with military Museum among them continued their work during the occupation. Collecting of objects and their preserving was main care for museum staff. Allied bombing of Belgrade in 1944 brought new destroying of museum buildings and collections. In new conditions, after the Second World War, new work on collecting objects started, especially from the previous war. Also adaptation of Display began in accordance to new ideology. Museum collections were significantly enriched, especially with objects from War and Revolution, and Military Museum became an important institution of new country. Great attention was given to acquisitions, expert personnel, researching, archaeological excavations and preparing of new display in which beside museum experts, many prominent historians, archaeologists, architects and various artists participated. New display was opened in 1961 by president Josip Broz Tito.\r\nAll important foreign delegations in Yugoslavia were guests of Military Museum. Museum organized large number of various exhibitions; edited several memorial complexes and commemorative rooms; issued several monographies, catalogues and other publications. Museum participated in symposiums and similar conferences I country and abroad. Special attention is given to acquisition of new objects and forming of collections. Today, Museum has around 33.000 objects in 15 collections and very impressive photo collection with over 100.000 photographs.\r\nMuseum has special library with over 15.000 titles from areas of History, History of Art, Archaeology, Museology and other similar branches of Science and with more than 6000 magazines.\r\n","administrativeStructure":"Military Museum is organizational unit of the Ministry of Defence.

Plans were made by Russian emigrant, architect Vasilyev. In 1926, new building appeared on postcards of Kalemegdan and Belgrade Fortress.\r\nBecause of the great devastation suffered by Military Museum residence during the Second World War and its small capacities for growing collection funds, it was necessary to find a new building. In 1955, Military Geographical institute moved into modern building and it was decided that the old one should be given to Military Museum. It was the most proper solution because of the fortress ambient that suited the thematic of the Museum. Large are of the building (1600 m2) was a good foundation for new permanent display and basement rooms were excellent for depots and conservation workshops. Adaptation of the building was led by well known architect, Djuka Kavurić, and it lasted from 1956 until 1959. Entire building, with certain enlargements, was adapted for specific needs of the Museum, according to modern standards.\r\nSince 1959 Military Museum resides in remarkable building that is one of landmarks of Belgrade Fortress.","holdings":"The museum preserves archival and other collections:\r\n- the Archeological Collection\r\n- Collection of West-European Weapons and Equipment\r\n- Collection of Handicraft Weapons from the Balkans\r\n- Collection of 19th Century Weapons until 1918\r\n- Collection of Decorations\r\n- Collection of Military Flags\r\n- Collection of Uniforms\r\n- Collection of Weapons from 1918 until 1945\r\n- Collection of Weapons since 1945\r\n- Art Work Collection\r\n- Photo documentation\r\n- Archival collection","openingTimes":"Permanent exhibition: every day 10.00 - 17.00\r\nLibrary: Monday, Wednesday and Friday 10.00 - 13.00","conditions":"Free access.","accessibility":"Researchers are asked to contact the museum before planning their visit.","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[44.82307,20.44791]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"rs","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/rs-006504","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/rs-006504/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/rs"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2019-06-24T13:51:37.085Z"}},{"id":"jp-006498","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"防衛省防衛研究所史料閲覧室","parallelFormsOfName":["Military Archives, National Institute for Defence Studies"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"5-1 ichigayahonmuracho, shinjuku-ku","city":"Tokyo","postalCode":"162-8808","country":"Japan","countryCode":"JP","email":[],"telephone":[],"fax":[],"url":["http://www.nids.mod.go.jp/english/military_archives/index.html"]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"jp","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/jp-006498","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/jp-006498/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/jp"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2019-06-24T06:54:24.519Z"}},{"id":"rs-006503","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Muzej \"12. februar\"","parallelFormsOfName":["Museum \"12 February\""],"otherFormsOfName":["Concentration camp \"Red Cross\""],"address":{"name":"Primary","contactPerson":"Nebojsa Ozimic, director","streetAddress":"Bulevar 12 februar bb","city":"Nis","postalCode":"18000","country":"Serbia","countryCode":"RS","email":["info@narodnimuzejnis.rs"],"telephone":["+38118588889"],"fax":[],"url":[]},"history":"The concentration camp \"Crveni krst\" (Red Cross) was established in mid-1941 by the German authorities.

According to some sources it is the third oldest synagogue in Europe, after the one in Prague, and Dubrovnik. ","generalContext":"Split developed within the great palace of the third-century Roman emperor Diocletian, which was located not far from the Roman town of Salona, Diocletian’s birthplace. Salona was destroyed by Avar invaders in the early seventh century, and the Jews of Salona are presumed to have sought refuge in the neighboring palace, forming a focus for settlement that survives to this day. The old Jewish quarter occupies the northwestern part of the former palace and is still known as the ghetto. Archeologists have also found inscribed menorot on the limestone blocks of the basement walls of the southwest part of the former palace.\r\n\r\nSalona (now a suburb of Split called Solin, where there is an archeological park) was the capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia and one of the most important commercial seaports on the Adriatic. Archaeological finds dating to the second and third centuries CE suggest a well-established Jewish community. Traces of a third-century Jewish cemetery were excavated, and finds included several objects decorated with menorahs, including a pendant, ceramic oil lamps, a fragment of a sarcophagus and the tombstone of a Syrian Jew named Malhos. These are now in the Split Archaeological Museum.\r\n\r\nThe Split Jewish community web site includes  information and pictures about the history of Jews in Dalmatia, the Split synagogue (originally built in the 16th century, renovated many times, with current appearance dating to about 1728) and the Old Jewish cemetery established in 1573 on Marjan Hill above the city.\r\n\r\nThe synagogue is in a residential building (Židovski prolaz 1) in the northwestern corner of the former palace. In 1942 Italian fascists ravaged the tiny sanctuary, throwing most of the ritual objects, archives, Torah scrolls, and books onto a bonfire in the main town square. The synagogue was restored after the Second World War and again renovated and reopened in 1996. It now shares a building with the Jewish community headquarters. The sanctuary is in a rectangular room with arched windows. The stone Ark is flanked by columns set under a decorative arch.\r\n\r\nThe oldest remaining gravestone in the Old Cemetery dates from 1717.  The rectangular plot includes some 700 tombstones from the 18th to 20th centuries; it remained in use until World War II. The tombstones are of the horizontal Sephardi type; some are shaped like a sarcophagus roof, and the others are flat, slightly inclined slabs. The tombstones have inscriptions in Hebrew, with additional epitaphs in Italian or Croatian on the newer monuments. The cemetery is surrounded by a gated wall. The entrance is beside a house that once functioned as a mikveh, and is now a café. The  new Jewish cemetery is a section of the Lovrinac municipal cemetery, where there is also a Holocaust memorial.\r\n\r\nIn the 16th century, Jews were organized in the association \"Università degli Ebrei\" (1533), sometimes referred to as the \"Scuola degli Ebrei\", \"Società di Spalato Ebraica\" and \"Comunità Israelitica di Spalato\". They had the General Assembly or Kahal Gadol, with the chief (7 'capo' or Gastaldi) that formed Va'ad (Council), which represented the community (procurators). \r\nThey were charitable societies, religious school, etc. In the XIX century, Jews have a number of charitable funds (\"Babait,\" \"Rabbi Meir\", \"Eretz Yisrael\", \"Horim,\" \"The Maori\" and so on). \r\n\r\nYear 1817 saw the establishment of the Jewish secular school as well as a religious school Talmud Torah. Rabbi Jacob Mussafia wrote \"Talmudic dictionary,\" and his son Abraham Adolfo Mussafia was one of the more famous European philologists of the time (he lived in Vienna). \r\nDuring the mediaeval times, more liberal rules on dressing were applied to Jews, while in other countries they were forced to wear special yellow caps, or other signs of recognition. Split did not implement measures of separate life in the ghetto, which is why in 1638 the count Pietro Basadonna complains to the Venetian government that \"Jews are scattered throughout the city and have the nicest and most comfortable flats. Their children are mixed regularly with Christian and go with them at public squares and sacred places, and nobody cares which of them are Christians, and which Jews\".\r\n \r\nIn 1940 there were 284 Jews in Split; around 150 survived the Holocaust. Jews were killed in Split after the capitulation of Italy: according to some sources, 22 children, 52 men and 47 women were taken in 1943 to the Banjica camp, then on March 11 1943 to the Jasenovac camp. Jews of Split significantly participated in the Anti-Fascist uprising, 29 of them fallen as resistance soldiers. \r\n\r\nSplit was shelter to a  large numbers of refugees from Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland, and then after the strengthening of the NDH, many were able to escape to the so-called Italian Zone. It is assumed that in Split at one point were 3,000 refugees, who were aided with the help of DELASEM (Italy). Children from Split were evacuated to Nonantola, and then onto British Mandate of Palestine.

The third department of the General Staff was given the task of “collecting data about the history of war, writing them up, arranging them and preserving them”, as well as to “manage the library and entire General Staff archive”. This History department within the General Staff was the predecessor of the current Military Archive. \r\n\r\nThe King’s regency regulation of March 6, 1940, transformed the History department into the Military History Institute. According to that regulation, the Institute was part of the General Staff and directly subordinate to it. History and War Experiment (Testing) Departments were established by the order of the Yugoslav People’s Liberation Army and the Partisans’ Supreme Commander on March 1, 1945, within the Yugoslav Army (YA) General Staff. Within the General Staff, there was also an Archival Department. In January 1946, the War Experiments Department was transformed into a separate unit, while the History Department was renamed the History Institute of the YA, and after April 1947, the Military Scientific and Publishing Institute. From Spring 1949 to Fall 2006, it was the Military History Institute, with the Military Archive as its part. \r\n\r\nFrom 1949 to 2006 there was the Vojnoistorijski institut (Military-historical Institute).

tra la metà del ‘300 e quella del ‘400, la presenza ebraica a Mantova era rappresentata solo da alcuni piccoli nuclei famigliari, la loro guida era nelle mani di pochi individui benpensanti che si occupavano della rappresentanza della Comunità verso il mondo esterno e della sua amministrazione all’interno. I documenti ed i libri mastri riguardanti questo piccolo gruppo di prestatori venivano conservati in casa di uno o dell’altro dei banchieri e non richiedevano un archivio od un posto particolare in cui conservarli in ordine.\r\nI primi segni di cambiamento di questa situazione si ebbero verso la fine del ‘400 quando, ampliandosi la Comunità, sorse la necessità di una organizzazione più democratica, con la partecipazione alla guida pubblica di più ampie cerchie di persone e con concentrazione del potere esecutivo nelle mani di persone in grado di dedicarsi a tempo pieno a questo compito.\r\nCon un simile cambiamento tutta la documentazione riguardante i rapporti sia interni, tra i singoli componenti della Comunità ebraica, sia esterni, tra la neonata “Università degli ebrei” e le autorità cittadine, acquistò evidentemente un valore assai maggiore e la sua corretta archiviazione diventò molto importante.\r\nVerso la metà del ‘500 nacque allora l’idea di predisporre una cassa in legno dotata di serratura destinata a contenere tutti i documenti riguardanti la vita comunitaria; una copia della chiave di questo cassone venne affidata a ciascuno dei tre massari in carica che probabilmente svolgevano il loro lavoro in qualche locale presso la Sinagoga Grande.\r\nCol passare del tempo l’archivio si ingrandì sensibilmente con ogni tipo di documenti: lettere, semplici ricevute di pagamenti o di prestiti, atti notarili, contratti di varia natura, resoconti processuali, registrazioni contabili, copie di bandi e di editti, scritture private, suppliche, inventari. Ovviamente molti erano i documenti scritti in ebraico e riguardanti rapporti comunitari interni; numerosi erano i documenti a stampa e le comunicazioni in italiano inviate dalle autorità cittadine alla “Università” per conoscenza (avvisi, editti, proclami); meno numerosi, ma ugualmente interessanti, erano i documenti a stampa in ebraico riguardanti le leggi suntuarie, le cosiddette pragmatiche.\r\nFinalmente, nel dicembre del 1778, il rabbino Azriel Yitzhaq Levi (o, col suo nome italiano, Bonaiuto Isacco), segretario della Comunità, correttore di bozze per la Tipografia d’Italia e poeta a tempo perso, ricevette dal Maggior Consiglio l’incarico di riordinare tutta la massa di documenti giacenti nell’archivio: “[…] onde ridurre alla più possibile utilità pubblica e privata l’Archivio di questa Comunità”.\r\nDal 1789 in poi il Levi, aiutato da un assistente, si dedicò con notevole capacità ed infinita pazienza al riordino e alla classificazione di tutto il materiale presente nell’archivio della Comunità ebraica di Mantova e scrisse un preciso e ricco “Repertorio Storico Enciclopedico dell’Archivio della Nazione Ebrea di Mantova sino a tutto l’anno 1790”; l’opera venne divisa in tre parti: Etica, Economia e Politica e fu manoscritta in dieci corposi volumi, tutti singoli tranne il quinto che è doppio.\r\nTutti i fogli cartacei vennero suddivisi per argomento e poi, all’atto della loro archiviazione, furono ‘infilzati’ al centro con un lungo ago che portava infilato nella cruna una sottile striscia di pelle terminante con un nodo. Questo sistema, per la verità drastico ed assai poco rispettoso dell’eventuale importanza del documento, spiega la presenza di un foro al centro di tutti i documenti raccolti nell’archivio.\r\nOggi l’Archivio storico della Comunità ebraica di Mantova ha la consistenza di alcune decine di migliaia di singoli documenti, parte manoscritti e parte a stampa; ciò è da considerarsi un evento quasi miracoloso specie se si pensa che questa enorme documentazione di rilevante valore storico è stata completamente e fortunatamente ignorata quando si trovava riposta in alcuni grossi armadi in un ufficio a piano terra della sede della Comunità durante l’occupazione tedesca tra il 1943 ed il 1944.","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[45.15485,10.79507]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"it","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/it-006457","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/it-006457/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/it"},"meta":{"subitems":1,"updated":"2019-05-09T08:50:25.610Z"}},{"id":"it-006456","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Archivio

presidium of the Special Committee, or “Cheka”, the registration archive department was formed. Its task was to gather and preserve incriminating materials about numerous “enemies” and “dangerous elements” of the country that the Cheka had exposed.\r\nThirty staff units were selected for the registration archive department. The first registered case was the criminal case of Razhden Mirianashvili (son of Malakia) and six others who were accused of appropriating foodstuffs.\r\nThree of the accused were sentenced to death. Officials executed the sentence the next day. Between 1921 and 1992, 230,000 archival files were stored in the cellar of the 10th department of the Committee for State Security (KGB).The former KGB’s central building caught fire in the “Tbilisi War” of 1991-1992. As a result, 210,000 archival files were destroyed - 80% of the entire collection. Many interesting documents are still preserved in\r\nthe KGB archive. Noteworthy documents include those on the rebellion of 1922-1924, the Civil War, the dissident movement, the events of March 9, 1956 in Tbilisi, the so-called “Mingrelian Case” and others. Fonds №1, №6, №8 and №12 can be found in the KGB archive. Fond №1 combines normative acts (decrees, orders and directives) passed by the former Cheka/GPU/OGPU/NKVD/MVD between 1921 and 1990. Fond №6\r\ncombines criminal cases of persons tried under the Article on political crimes, cases of those tried under the Article on treason, and cases of those tried under various Articles of the criminal code. Fond №8 combines protocols of the board, presidium, special advisory and the so-called “Troika” of the former Cheka/GPU/OGPU/NKVD/MVD. Fond №12 combines documents concerning death-penalty executions.","researchServices":"A researcher may request access to archival holdings.

From this moment begins the formation of the structure of the archival system of the region. With the decision number 251 of the Presidium of the executive committee of the South Kazakhstan region of March 29, 1935, the bureau of the district archive re-formed the district archive attached to the Kyzylorda district executing committee, although the old name “district archives” was spoken together. In 1938, the district archives created a management of the archives of the region.","openingTimes":"Work time: 9:00-19:00\r\nLunch: 13:00-15:00\r\nClosed: Saturday, Sunday\r\n "},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"kz","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/kz-006433","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/kz-006433/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/kz"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2019-05-07T11:34:44.867Z"}},{"id":"sk-003289","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Štátny archív v Prešove, pracovisko Archív Vranov nad Topľou","parallelFormsOfName":["State Archive in Prešov, workplace Archive Vranov nad Topľou"],"otherFormsOfName":["Štátny archív v Prešove - Pobočka Vranov nad Topľou (until 2015)","State Archive in Prešov: the Vranov nad Topľou Branch (until 2015)"],"address":{"streetAddress":"Budovateľská 1277","city":"Vranov Nad Topľou","postalCode":"093 01","country":"Slovakia","countryCode":"SK","email":["archiv.po.vt@minv.sk"],"telephone":["+421 57 4887940"],"fax":["+421 57 4464908"],"url":["https://www.minv.sk/?statny-archiv-v-presove-pobocka-vranov-nad-toplou"]},"history":"In late 2015, the archival system of the Slovak state archives has been reorganised.
