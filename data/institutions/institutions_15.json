It consolidated three major archives that existed in Lviv up until the Second World War,- the Archives of old deeds of the city of Lviv, the Land archives, and the State archives, as well as a number of well-known corporate and private collections.\r\nAt first, the Central Archives of Ancient Deeds was considered an archival branch of the UNKVS UkrSSR of Lviv oblast. On June 24, 1941, the archives was reorganized as a branch of the Central State Historical Archives of the UkrSSR (the decree was passed on December 1, 1943); however, this resolution was not carried out due to the outbreak of the war. During the German occupation of 1941-1944, the activity of the archives was renewed under the name of the Archives of the City of Lviv, reporting to the Archival Management of the General-Governor in Kraków. From 1944 to 1945, the archives existed as a department of ancient deeds under the Lviv oblast state archives; after 1946, it was again a branch of TsDIA UkSSR.\r\nAs a result of the division of documents between the TsDIA branch and the Lviv oblast state archives between 1947-1950, collections relating to Austrian and Polish institutions and organizations in Galicia and activities which occurred outside the borders of the Lviv Voivodship (excluding documents from the era of the feudalism) were absorbed into the TsDIA.\r\nIn 1958, the archives was reorganized into the TsDIA UkSSR in Lviv reporting to the Archives administration of the RM UkrSSR. At the beginning of the 1960s, initiated by academic I.

Inclusion of Ukrainian cine photo documents of history-making value into the National archival fond as well as creation of the All-Ukrainian Central Photo Archives in Kyiv was provided by the Regulation \"On Unified State Archival Fond of Ukrainian SSR\" (1930) and the Regulation \"On Central Department for Archives, Local Archival Bodies and Institutions under the Department for Archives and Local Bodies\" (1932).\r\nWithin the pre-war period the Archives was located on the territory of Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra (the Museum area, Building 26) occupying sew rooms, a photo documents depository and a photo laboratory.\r\n\r\nOriginally the Archives was formed through acquisition of photo documents. The first cine documents were registered in 1940. By January 1, 1941 105 330 photo negatives, 9 655 photo positives and 50 430 metrs of film were reported to be put under archival control.\r\n\r\nWhen the war between Nazi Germany and the USSR broke out the archival records were not evacuated. The majority of the photo documents were transferred to the Propaganda Department (17 Prorizna st.) under the Headquarters of A. Rozenberg by the Main Working Group in Ukraine; some photo documents (241 units) were passed over to the Museum-Archives of Transition Period (Muzei-arkhiv perekhodovoi doby) at Kyiv City Administration (uprava). Later some amount of photo documents remaining at the archives depository was wrecked as a consequence of the explosions at the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra. In September - October, 1943 the archival documents were removed out of Ukraine.\r\n\r\nAfter liberation of Kyiv, according to the Order of the People's Comissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVS) of Ukrainian SSR of December 1, 1943 №021 the Central State Archives of Photo Phono Cine Documents of Ukrainian SSR was reorganised. H. Pshenychnyi was appointed its Director, he had been at the head of the Archives for 35 years. In 1953-1992 it was the Central State Archives of Cine Photo Phono Documents of Ukrainian SSR. Since July, 1992 it is the Central State Cine Photo Phono Archives of Ukraine (TsDKFFA of Ukraine). In accordance with the Decree of Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of December 28, 1998 № 2088 TsDKFFA of Ukraine was named after H. Pshenychnyi.\r\n\r\nFormation of archival document base was one of the priorities of the TsDkFFA activity.\r\n\r\nIn 1943 the Scientific Library of the Academy of Sciences of Ukrainian SSR passed the archives photo documents of the Antireligious Museum as well as of Kyiv Opera and Ballet Theatre archives. In 1946-1947 50 000 photo documents were returned to TsDKFFA from Dresden (Germany) and 17 190 photo documents from Vienna (Austria). In 1997 the Federal Archives of Germany (Koblenz) passed the archives 3278 copies of photo positives removed from Ukraine.\r\n\r\nWithin postwar period regional cinema distribution departments passed TsDKFFA German and Rumanian propagandistic documentaries and newsreels; in 1948 TsDKFFA received 126 working copies of \"Radianska Ukraiina\" (\"The Soviet Ukraine\") newsreel and 1938-1941 Ukrkinochronica (\"Ukrainian newsreels\") documentaries from the USSR Central State Archives of Cine Photo Phono Documents. In 1956 Central State Archives of Cine Photo Phono Documents of the USSR passed to TsDKFFA of Ukraine a number of VUFKU (All-Ukrainian Photo Cine Department) and Soiuzkinochronica (\"The USSR newsreels\") 19230-1936 newsreels and films. The above documents were the core of the source base for the pre-war archives which in the course of time were supplemented with the copies of Ukrainian episodes of Soiuzkinochronica newsreels.\r\n\r\nThe gradual accumulation of cine documents required their storage and preservation issues to be solved. In view of it a new three-storey building was put into operation in 24 Solomianskaia st. on January 1, 1975. The new archives premises (about 3265 sq.m) cover the depositories of cine, photo and phono documents.\r\n\r\n","generalContext":"Archive contains visual and phonographic materials documenting newest history of the Ukraine from middle of XIX century until today.

The earliest cine documents are presented by fragmentary episodes of Nicolas II coronation (1896), \"The 200th Anniversary of Poltava Battle\" (1900), \"Flights of Aviator Utochkin in Kishinev\" (1911), \"Funeral of A. Tereshchenko\" (1912). Invaluable cine chronicles of Ukrainian life of 1920s-1930s are VUFKU and Ukrkinochronica newsreels, documentaries of Kyiv Feature Films Studio, some Romanian and Czech films and episodes on Transcarpathian Ukraine as a part of pre-war Czechoslovakia. WW II cine chronicles are presented, first and foremost, by the so-called \"chronicles materials\", that is, shooting of Ukrainian cameramen; \"Radianska Ukraiina\" (\"The Soviet Ukraine\") newsreels (1943 - May, 1945); a number of films and the so-called \"war trophies\" newsreels.\r\n\r\nThe dominant subject of the first postwar decade was reconstruction and further development of the national economy, science and culture.\r\n\r\nThe cine documents, such as numerous episodes and films, highlighted all stages of the Soviet society development, such as destalinization period, the so-called \"thaw\", the mid-1980s \"glasnost and perestroika\" period, \"blank spots\" of the Soviet history. A number of Ukrainian documentaries are devoted to the memory of Stalin repressions victims, tragic fate of Ukrainian intelligentsia, 1986 Chornobyl disaster etc. The cine documents of independent Ukraine reflect the latest history of the state.\r\n\r\nThe TsDKFFA funds also contain about 400 000 units of photo documents (1853-2004). The earliest of them are the copies of T. Shevchenko's photo portraits, the events of Sevastopol defense during 1853-1856 Crimean War, the photo album of Kyiv pictures (the 2nd half of XIX century), the 1896 original glass negative with the image of a blast furnace construction at \"Union\" metallurgical plant in Makyivka.\r\n\r\nThe photo documents reflect the 1917-1921 liberation movement in Ukraine, setting the Soviet power, creation of the USSR, activities of public authorities, development of Ukrainian science and culture. More than 6 000 photo documents highlight the events of WW II. Most of the photo documents depict Ukrainian history during the previous 50 years. Contemporary Ukraine is presented by the photo documents on Declaration of Independence of Ukraine, the first Presidential elections, inauguration of L. Kravchuk, the first President of Ukraine, as well as political, public and economic life of the independent country.\r\n\r\nMore than 59 000 items of sound recordings documents (1900-2003) are preserved at TsDKFFA of Ukraine. Small but a unique collection of records produced by \"Zonophone Record\" (\"Grammophone Joint-Stock Company, Riga\"), \"Stella Record\", \"Beka Record\" and \"Favourite Record\" companies (Germany) in 1900-1914 is of immesurable value.\r\n\r\nDuring 1970s-1980s the TsDKFFA record fond was filled up with new entries on a regular basis, mostly with \"Melodiia\" (\"The Melody\") records. Of special value are the recordings of Ukrainian opera coryphees I. Patorzhynskyi, V. Lytvynenko-Volgemut, I. Kozlovskyi, Z. Haidai, M. Hryshko and others. The majority of phono documents are magnetic recordings of documentary character.\r\n\r\nSince 1998 TsDKFFA of Ukraine have been acquiring video documents; their number amounting to 800 items (1994-2005). The very first entries were as follows: \"Visti Tyzhnia\" (\"News Weekly\"), \"Vikna\" (\"Windows\"), \"Pisliamova\" (\"Afterword\") TV programs.

In the late 1980s – early 1990s, when processes of national revival began, there was no expert in Jewish Studies in Ukraine who could help resume this research. We started practically from scratch, inspired by the striving to know and understand our past and present for the sake of a dignified life and future of our children.\r\n\r\nThe Institute tackles about 30 projects and programs. Among them are a number of research projects, a large-scale historical-archival program, the study of oral history, integral projects, such as creation of the “Jewish Life in Ukraine” Encyclopedia, conceptual topical exhibitions, etc.\r\n\r\nWithin the framework of the program for the preservation of the Jewish cultural heritage, the we created and constantly replenish the archive of the Institute, storing unique personal and public documents, personal archives of writers, artists, and figures of Jewish culture of Ukraine, photographs, works of arts, books, and many other materials that have been collected and preserved by the staff of the Institute.\r\n\r\nThe Institute is also involved in a lot of publishing projects .

The project envisages search, collection, and description of private and government-kept archives of figures of Jewish culture.\r\nThe Institute searches for heirs of writers, artists, figures of culture and arts in order to receive materials from their private archives, or copies thereof. Most of this inheritance is still unknown to researchers. It can be found in different cities and countries. Sometimes, their heirs, many of whom do not know the language or the culture of the unique materials they possess, preserve personal archives of writers. The state archives of Ukraine also have a significant number of materials on Jewish studies, which have not yet been identified as Jewish. Neither were they ever used.\r\nThe project envisages publication of books and artistic albums with the purpose of introducing the public to the Jewish cultural heritage that was destroyed during the Holocaust and Gulag. For more successful organization of search and research within this project and for further development of these topics, work is underway on creation of computer databases of figures of the Jewish culture of Ukraine of the end of the 19th – beginning of the 20th, as well as creation of bibliographic and reference materials.\r\n\r\nDescription of Jewish funds and materials in archives of Ukraine\r\n\r\nFor a number of years now, the Jewish Studies Institute has been involved in search for and description of Jewish materials in the funds of archives, museums, and libraries of Ukraine. Within the framework of the project, research has been underway in the funds of Kiev archives, in particular, in the Central State Historical Archive of Ukraine (CSHAU), in the Central State Archive of Higher Bodies of Power and Administration of Ukraine (CSAHBPA of Ukraine), the State Archive of the Kiev Region (SAKR), the State Archive of the City of Kiev (SACK), the Central State Archive of Public Associations of Ukraine (CSAPA of Ukraine; former archive of the Institute of Party History under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine), the Archive of the Presidium of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (the Archive of Presidium of NAS of Ukraine), the Central State Archive of Film, Photo, and Phono Documents of Ukraine (CSAFPPD of Ukraine), the Central State Archive-Museum of the History of Literature and Arts of Ukraine (CSAMHLA of Ukraine), in the Institute of Manuscripts of the National Vernadsky Library of the National Academy of Sciences (NL of NAS of Ukraine), and in the archive of the Security Service of Ukraine – former archive of KGB (NKVD) of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.\r\nOn top of this, workers of the Institute described materials on the Jewish history and culture found in the archives of other cities of Ukraine: in the State Archive of the Ternopil Region, the State Archive of the Ivano-Frankivsk Region, in the Lviv Regional Archive (the fund of the regional prosecutor’s office and funds of institutions of learning), and in the Central State Historical Archive of Ukraine in the city of Lviv.\r\nThe archives of Kiev contain fragments from registers, legal acts that were adopted in Poland and the Russian Empire concerning the Jewish people and that speak of relations between the Christian and Jewish population.\r\nThe Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk archives contain documents of the Nazi occupational authorities’ orders concerning the Jewish people; correspondence between the chief of the security police and SD and the German state administration in Lviv on how some Ukrainians and Poles violate Nazi orders and help Jewish people; accusations of certain individuals of various forms of assistance to the Jews. The Ivano-Frankivsk archive contains materials on the activities of almost 100 Jewish organizations that operated between the two wars.\r\nIn the Central State Historical Archive of Ukraine in Lviv, the State Archive of the Ternopil Region, and the State Archive of the Ivano-Frankivsk Region, the following documents dated 1945-1956 were found and processed: on organization of Jewish religious festivals; on the situation with the religious life in the region; on Jewish communities; reports of personnel departments of certain establishments and district city administrations on Jews’ applications to move to Poland; information about the ethnic composition of specialists in the system of education, medicine, etc.\r\nSources on Jewish history are found in the Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian languages, as well as in Yiddish and Hebrew. Some documents are in German, French, English, and Arab. Most of the researched materials have never been published before.\r\nAs a result of the research of the archival funds of Kiev, in 2001, Victoria Khiterer published her book “Documents on Jewish History of the 16th – 20th Centuries in Kiev Archives. – Kiev – Moscow: Jewish Studies Institute – Bridges of Culture”.\r\n\r\nProgram “Jewish Addresses of Ukraine”. Preparation of a Guide\r\n\r\nAmong many historical and cultural monuments of Ukraine there are many objects related to the Jewish history and culture. These are religious, architectural, and ethnographic monuments, necropolises, museum and archival collections. Such outstanding figures as Baal Shem Tov, rabbi Nachman Bratslavsky, Martin Buber, Chaim Nachman Byalik, Vladimir (Zeyev) Zhabotinsky, Golda Meir, Sholom-Aleichem, and many others lived and worked in this country.\r\nFor a number of years now, the Jewish Studies Institute has been involved in the study of these objects and the development of tour routes to the Jewish memorable places of Ukraine. Among them are tours to the shtetls of Western Ukraine, topical tours to the Jewish places of Kiev and other cities, etc. In 1998, the map of the “Jewish Addresses of Kiev” was published for the first time. It has been republished several times since then.\r\nSince 2000, within the framework of this program, we have been working on a guide of “Jewish Addresses of Ukraine” (author and compiler – Mikhail Kalnitsky). The structure of the guide contains such historically formed regions of the Jewish Diaspora as the Kiev region, Podolye, Volyn, Novorossia, Crimea, Galicia, and Bukovina. A review article is devted to each one of these regions. These are followed by the guide of routes developed for every populated locality, with the review of its general history and the history of its Jewish population. Separate chapters are devoted to the Jewish population of big cities of other regions: Kharkov, Poltava, Chernigov, etc.\r\nTexts are prepared on the basis of topical developments of the Jewish Studies Institute, libraries of the Jewish regional literature on local lore and periodicals, materials collected during the work of the Committee for Preservation of Jewish Heritage of Ukraine, and archival materials.\r\nThe guide includes a lot of illustrations, among which are some unknown ones that have been found in archives and private collections. The guide will reflect the modern activities of Jewish communities as well. Text in the guide will be in Ukrainian and English.\r\n\r\nPreparation of the “Encyclopedia of Jewish Life in Ukraine”\r\n\r\nProject leader – L. Finberg; editors: M. Feller, V. Grinevich, and L. Grinevich\r\nThe Encyclopedia is designed as a monument to the generations of the Jewish people who have been living in the land of Ukraine for more than a thousand years. They created a culture of their own. For ages they preserved and are now reviving common Jewish traditions.\r\nThe Encyclopedia will be not only a reference book, but also a textbook for schools and universities, because most of the topics it touches on will be covered there for the first time. Therefore when choosing among the alphabetical and topical structure of the Encyclopedia, the latter was preferred.\r\nAmong more than 80 authors of the Encyclopedia, there are four academicians and correspondent members of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (Y. Dashkevich, Y. Isayevich, V. Moskovich, and O. Pritsak), 13 Ph.D. (G. Aronov, V. Gorsky, V. Gusev, S. Kvyt, V. Malakhov, F. Petryakova, V. Skuratovsky, M. Feller, Y. Khonigsman, and others), and more than 30 candidates.\r\nThe editorial board of the Encyclopedia decided to deviate from the division of materials by topics, which is typical of topical encyclopedias (for instance, international relations, religion, literature, arts). They decided to structure the Encyclopedia by historical periods, and only within those – by subjects.\r\nThus, the Encyclopedia will consist of seven sections:\r\n1. «Ancient Times and Middle Ages»\r\n2. «Jews in Ukrainian Ethnic Lands (end of the 18th – beg. of the 20th cc.)\r\n3. «First World War. Ukrainian Revolution and Civil War. (1914 – beg. of 1920s)\r\n4. «Ukrainian Jews Between the Wars»\r\n5. «Ukrainian Jews in Second World War. Holocaust of the Ukrainian Jewry»\r\n6. «Period After the War»\r\n7. «Modern Jewry of Ukraine».\r\nTo make it easier for readers to get to the specific facts in the Encyclopedia, the compilers will make a subject and name index of it, as well as a dictionary of subjects and terms related to the Jewish life and traditions.\r\nMost of the materials of the Encyclopedia have been prepared. Its texts are undergoing literary and scientific editing at the moment.\r\n\r\nHistory of the Jews in the Soviet period\r\n\r\nThis is one of the main topics that that Institute is working on. In 2003, the Institute prepared for publication and in 2004 printed the book of M. Mitsel «Jews of Ukraine in 1943-1953. Reviews of Documented History», “Library of the Jewish Studies Institute” series, Duh I Litera, 2004.\r\nMany other research works of the Institute relate to this subject as well. First and foremost, they are collected in the materials for the “Encyclopedia of Jewish Life in Ukraine”, in the articles by G. Aronov, M. Mitsel, Zh. Kovba, V. Grinevich, Y. Khonigsman, A. Podolsky, V. Gusyev, V. Lubchenko, Y. Melamed, and others.\r\n\r\nJewish religious communities in Ukraine after the Second World War\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to study the attitude of the Ukrainian Socialist authorities to Judaism after the Second World War and to find documentary materials on the lives of synagogues and religious communities in Kiev and Lviv. Research was carried out in 1995-1998 at the Central State Archive of Public Associations of Ukraine (CSAPAU), at the Central Archive of Higher Bodies of Power and Administration of Ukraine (CAHBPAU), at the State Archive of the Kiev Region (SAKR), and at the State Archive of the Lviv Region (SALO).\r\nResearchers collected and analyzed documents of various bodies of power, materials on Jewish religious communities in the CSAPAU (former party archive of the Institute of Party History under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine), in after-the-war bodies of materials of Fund №1 (materials of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine). Work has also been done with materials of Fund № 4648 (Religious Council) of the CSAHBU and in the funds of the Kiev and Lviv district committees of the Communist Party in the SAKR and SALR.\r\nOn the basis of these archival materials, the “Library of the Jewish Studies Institute” published Mikhail Mitsel’s book “Jewish Religious Communities in Ukraine (Kiev – Lviv, 1945-1981)\" – K., Jewish Studies Institute, 1998. – 261 p. ISBN 966-7273-07-5. The book contains historical reviews on the attitude of the Ukrainian Socialist authorities to Judaism after the Second World War (after 1944) and documents on the lives of synagogues and religious communities in Kiev and Lviv.\r\n\r\nJewish scientific establishments in the system of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in 1919-1949\r\n\r\nThis project helped find and research documents and materials relating to the work of academic Jewish scientific and research organizations: the Jewish Historical Archeographical Commission, the Jewish Proletarian Culture Chair of the Institute of Jewish Proletarian Culture, and the Cabinet of Jewish Culture. Work was carried out at the Central State Archive of the Higher Bodies of Power and Administration of Ukraine, at the Central State Archive of Public Associations of Ukraine, at the archive of the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, and at the Institute of Manuscripts of the National Vernadsky Library of Ukraine of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.\r\nThese materials and research reveal a complicated process of turning Jewish scientific researches that had many directions in the 1920s into those of one-direction in the 1930s against the background of the general tendencies of the development of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences.\r\nSpecial attention must be given to the documents revealing the role of state, party, and scientific establishments, as well as the significance of the personal factor in the functioning of Jewish scientific and research organizations in the system of the Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\n“History of the Holocaust in Ukraine” database\r\n\r\nThe objective of this large-scale project of the Jewish Studies Institute is to create an expanded reference system that would unity all the known materials on the history of the Holocaust in Ukraine that have been found and described by Ukrainian and foreign researchers, including by the workers of the Jewish Studies Institute. Such an easily accessible system will help today’s and future researchers of the history of the Holocaust find their orientation in the vast volume of sources. We also hope it will help optimize and speed up the study and comprehension of the existing materials, many of which are still little known.\r\nThe database includes:\r\n1. Description of the funds and documents of the Holocaust in the archives of Ukraine, including search for and, if possible, description of specific documents (annotations, date of writing, date of the events described, language, size, etc.).\r\n2. Description of the place of location of the Nazi concentration camps, forced labor camps for the Jewish people, ghettos, and prisons in the territory of Ukraine in 1941–1944, and reference to the relating documents.\r\n3. Description of sites of mass burials and shootings of the Jews in the territory of Ukraine during the Nazi occupation in 1941–1944. It includes the description of sites of mass burial, presence of monuments, memorial signs, and other information.\r\n4. Description of documents and funds in foreign archives.\r\n5. Anti-Semitic articles in the periodical press of the Nazi-occupied zone in 1941-1944\r\n6. Stories about the Holocaust in the archive of oral stories, etc.\r\nIn addition, a reference section of the project is being compiled now. It will include information about international and Ukrainian organizations that are involved in the study of the Holocaust; bibliography of documentary and fiction materials devoted to the Holocaust; website addresses where information on this subject can be found; addresses and contact information of archives, museums, and libraries of Ukraine.\r\n\r\nProject “Rabbis and Catholic Priests of Eastern Galicia during Second World War”\r\n\r\nThis work uses materials of a number of archives (the Central State Historical Archive in Lviv, the archives of the Lviv and Ternopil regions), periodicals (Polish, Armenian, and Ukrainian) of the between-the-wars and the war periods, published reminiscences of rabbis and priests, testimonies of the indigenous residents of Eastern Galicia, recorded in 1998-2001, and modern theological and historical-philosophical literature.\r\nThe project focuses on the following questions: religious life of Christians (Greek Catholics, Roman Catholics) and Jews (Orthodox, Chassidic, and Reform), activities of religious communities, religious schools (seminaries, academies, yeshivas, and kheders), publication and distribution of mass and scientific theological literature of the war period.\r\nSpecial attention is paid to the attitude of religious figures and institutions to political, economic, and national movements, especially in extreme situations of the 1930s; the influence of priests and rabbis on the conduct, ethnic relations, and contacts between rabbis and Catholic priests, formation of a Judeo-Christian dialogue, and religious conflicts.\r\nThe idea of fear for punishment for sins and calls to repentance by different denominations prior to the war is analyzed. Description is given to the facts and events of religious life of Galicia residents during the Soviet rule (1939-1941), of the practice and aftermath of declared atheism, separation of the religious tradition, the conflict of generations, the leveling of the influence of priests and rabbis on the conduct of people.\r\nMain attention is focused on the religious life of the Galicians during the Nazi occupation. Facts are analyzed of restricted activities, strict control and persecution of the Christian clergy; of specially cruel attitude, torture, and murder of rabbis, tsadiks, and Chassidim, the burning down of synagogues, and other acts of annihilation of the Jewish spiritual life. Religious life in ghettos is studied, as well as the influence of rabbis on the activities of Judenrat, on making situational decisions that would determine the further destiny of the community and of individuals, facts of comprehension of the tragedy of the Jewry.\r\nThe project analyzes how Galician Ukrainians and Poles are preserving the memory of rabbis, their sacrificial acts, and their “quiet heroism”.\r\nOn top of that, it analyzes the attitude of the Greek Catholic Church to the destruction of the Jewish people, actions of rescue of women and children, of baptism, of clergy’s influence upon the laymen’s attitude to the terrible fate of the Jewish people, and of anti-Semitic propaganda. It researches facts of anti-Semitic conduct among priests and laymen. The project also analyzes the silencing of the truth about the Holocaust in the Soviet Union and in the Ukrainian Republic, active anti-Catholic propaganda, falsification of the activities of the clergy of Eastern Galicia during the Second World War, and aftermath of preservation and loss of religious traditions in the lives of the population of Galicia.\r\n\r\nConduct of Local Population of Eastern Galicia During the “Final Solution of the Jewish Question”\r\n\r\nOn the basis of archival materials (from the archives of the Ternopil, Lviv, and Ivano-Frankivsk regions, the Cetnral State Archive of Higher Bodies of Power of Ukraine), the analysis of the content and form of delivery of the materials in periodicals of Eastern Galicia during the Nazi occupation period of 1941-1945 on ethnic relations, national policy of Germany, and on the basis of the published memoirs recorded by the author from 150 indigenous Galician residents: Ukrainians, Poles, Jews, and their descendents who carry the historical memory, the project covers social and economic conditions of life of the three nations between the two wars and during the Second World War. Main attention is focused on the conduct of the local population during the Holocaust in Galicia.\r\nThe object of research is traditional ethnic relations that shaped during the 19th century and changed under the influence of five governments that the Galicians experienced during the 45 years of the 20th century.\r\nSpecial attention was given to the tragedy of the Galician Jews, peculiarities of creation and work of organizations and structures for annihilation of the Jewish population: ghettos, forced labor camps, deportation to death camps, and mass shootings. Analysis was made of numerous German orders, their system of prohibitions and punishments (death) for Poles and Ukrainians for their contacts and assistance to the Jews.\r\nAnother topic of this research can be headlined “Violence. Indifference. Compassion. Organized Help”.\r\nThe project examines facts of passive resistance of the local population to the “new order” and positions of political and militarized organizations of Ukrainians and Poles concerning the destruction of the Jewish population. It analyzes in detail the activities of the Orthodox and Catholic churches, in particular, the rescue of Jewish women and children in monasteries and orphanages that was organized by Metropolitan Sheptitsky and carried out by nuns and monks.\r\nMaterials have been collected on the rescue of Jews in the cities, towns, and villages of Galicia by Ukrainians and Poles, who have been officially named Righteous Gentiles in the last five years.\r\nFor the first time, names were gathered of those Galicians who, while risking their own lives and the lives of their families, helped Jewish people and were killed by the fascists; the names of those who survived and had to live in silence in the territory of the former Soviet Union in order to avoid trouble or arrests of themselves or those they had rescued.\r\nIn the context of the documented facts and testimonies, the project analyzes historical and household myths and stereotypes, “white spots” in the Holocaust of the Jews of Eastern Galicia."},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"ua","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/ua-003315","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/ua-003315/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/ua"},"meta":{"subitems":2,"updated":"2019-04-07T11:54:02.696Z"}},{"id":"ua-003297","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Український інститут вивчення Голокосту «Ткума» ","parallelFormsOfName":["\"Tkuma\" Ukrainian Institute for Holocaust Studies ","Ukrainskyi institut vyvchennya Holokostu \"Tkuma\" "],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"4 Sholom-Aleichem Str.","city":"Dnipro","region":"Dnipropetrovsk oblast","postalCode":"49000","country":"Ukraine","countryCode":"UA","email":["tkuma@tkuma.com"],"telephone":["38 (056) 717-70-17"],"fax":["38 (056) 717-70-17"],"url":["http://tkuma.dp.ua/en/index.php"]},"history":"The history of “Tkuma” Ukrainian Institute for Holocaust Studies creation goes back to 1999.

Between 1940 and 1945 significant work was done to centralize these state archives, while Austria was part of Germany's Third Reich. In 1983 the \"Archiv der Republik\" was founded as part of the Austrian archival system. Consequently other departments of the State Archives had to transfer to it their official records of the First Republic, the National-Socialist era and the Second Republic. In 1981 a new building was created in Vienna-Erdberg (Nottendorfer Gasse 2-4, 1030 Vienna); today it holds the General Directorate, the restoration workshop, the central library of the State Archives and the following archival departments: Allgemeines Verwaltungsarchiv, Archiv der Republik, Kriegsarchiv and Finanz- und Hofkammerarchiv.","holdings":"There are four main archival departments of the Austrian State Archives: Allgemeines Verwaltungsarchiv, Archiv der Republik, Kriegsarchiv and Finanz- und Hofkammerarchiv.

After the government moved to Taiwan in 1949, Academia Sinica was re-established in Taipei. The growth of Academia Sinica during the transition period was initially slow due to political instability and meager budgets.\r\nThanks to the great efforts of the past and former Presidents, Academia Sinica overcame many difficulties to reach its present success. It is now a modern research institution with a worldwide reputation and a proud tradition. Academia Sinica is making further progress in improving research conditions and results. Many of the twenty-four research institutes and seven research centers are now headed by world-renowned scholars and staffed by highly trained, motivated, and creative young investigators. Major strides have also been made toward raising the standards of academic research, and Academia Sinica is presently positioning itself to move its research activities to the international level. Aside from placing greater emphasis on opening up new areas of intellectual endeavor, Academia Sinica is also taking a leadership role in launching new initiatives in applied areas to meet a broad spectrum of social needs in Taiwan.\r\nIn order to fulfill these goals, Academia Sinica has adopted various measures to promote the internal integration of research activities in the three research disciplines of mathematics and physical sciences, life sciences, and humanities and social sciences; to improve the planning, implementation, and evaluation of long-term projects in order to enhance the impact of the research activities; to harness basic research results for applications and technology transfer; to engage the entire academic and research community in Taiwan in a modern and forward-looking collective academic vision; to cultivate an intellectual environment that is conducive to the nurturing of young scholars and the recognition of outstanding scholarship in Taiwan; and to promote international cooperation and scholarly exchanges that will accelerate the overall development of academic research in Academia Sinica and the Republic of China.","holdings":"The archives contain important original historical records, and serve as a major repository for research on modern Chinese history. The archives were established within the Institute of Modern History so that the functions of archival storage and historical research could be carried out in one place, It was hoped that this arrangement would facilitate historical studies and encourage greater interest in modern Chinese history. The records in the archives are divided between diplomatic archives (1860s-1970s), economic archives (1903-1980s), personal papers, etc. The total length of all the files combined is approximately 10,000 meters.\r\n","openingTimes":"Monday to Friday 8:30-17:00, Closed Saturdays, Sundays, and National holidays"},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"tw","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/tw-006380","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/tw-006380/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/tw"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2019-03-13T13:51:39.851Z"}},{"id":"tw-006379","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"National Archives of Taiwan ","parallelFormsOfName":[],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Zhongping Road, 439, 9F., North Tower,","city":"New Taipei City","region":"Xinzhuang District","postalCode":"24220","country":"Taiwan","countryCode":"TW","email":["archives@archives.gov.tw"],"telephone":["+886 2 8995 3700"],"fax":[],"url":["https://www.archives.gov.tw/english/"]},"history":"In order to improve the management and transparency of important documentation, on December 15, 1999 the ROC government passed the Archives Act.
