In 1994, the Constitutional Court was examining the constitutionality of the law that had ordered the lustration of people in important public positions. They stated that the Parliament acted against the Constitution by not providing for people’s informational self-determination when they ordered their lustration. At the same time the Parliament was obligated to make an end to this anti-constitutional situation by legislating people’s right to become acquainted with all the personal data gathered and kept by State Security Organizations. Modifying the Law of Screening in 1997, the Parliament set up the Historical Office, which was archives despite its name. In 2003, as a by-product of the scandal following the publicity of the State Security past of the then Prime Minister, Parliament founded the Historical Archives of the Hungarian State Security (hereafter: Historical Archives orÁBTL) by a new Act. The Historical Archives is the legal successor of the Historical Office. The Historical Archives regularly co-operates with organizations and institutions in Hungary and abroad. The institute conducts scholarly research projects, organizes public lectures, exhibitions and international conferences. The Historical Archives' own research department and visiting scholars regularly publish their results in the publications of the institute as well as on its website (http://www.betekinto.hu/).","generalContext":"Hungary","holdings":"The Historical Archives preserves and handles the documents of the former State Security Organizations dating from the period between December 21, 1944, and February 14, 1990, and the documents of the Screening Committee controlling certain persons performing important, public confidence and public opinion forming positions from the period 1994 and 2005. The archival material of the Historical Archives is divided into sections. The largest and most important one is Section 3 Network, operative and investigation files (1851) 1945-90 (2003), which contains the majority of the documents of the Archives, including investigation files, operation files, work files, enlisting files etc. At the end of 2011, the quantity of documents kept in the Historical Archives was 3953 linear metres. More than two thirds of this quantity are documents of different types of files. The rest is made up of functional documents of the former State Security Organizations and the collections, background documents and contemporary registers created and used by those organizations. The Archives maintains mainly paper-based records, but we also have large quantities of contemporary security microfilm copies of investigation and operation files and Daily Operation Information Reports.","openingTimes":"The Historical Archives of the Hungarian State Security is open to researchers on Mondays and Wednesdays from 9am to 4 pm and on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10am to 6 pm.","accessibility":"In order to reach the Historical Archives of the Hungarian State Security we suggest taking Metro Line no. 1. or Trams no. 4 or 6 to the stop Oktogon.

Altri archivi (parte della direzione di polizia di Trieste , tribunali di guerra, processi politici già estratti dal tribunale provinciale di Trieste e documentazione relativa ai militari di queste terre), evacuati durante il periodo bellico in altre zone più sicure dell'impero austro-ungarico, furono a loro volta recuperati nel periodo 1919-1924. Successivi versamenti da parte degli uffici subentrati a quelli austriaci hanno permesso di completare gli archivi dell'amministrazione politica, giudiziaria, finanziaria e marittima anteriori all'annessione di Trieste all'Italia. A Trieste furono concentrati dopo il 1918, in assenza di Archivi di Stato a Gorizia e Udine, alcuni fondi relativi a queste province, i quali vennero colà trasferiti dopo l'istituzione dei rispettivi Archivi. A Fiume esisteva una sezione di Archivio di Stato, mentre a Pola non ne venne mai istituita una, benché prevista dalla l. 22 dic. 1939, n. 2006. In seguito alla seconda guerra mondiale Trieste ha perduto, in momenti diversi, il suo retroterra carsico e istriano. Per quanto attiene alla vicenda degli archivi posteriore al 1943 va segnalato che l'archivio del tribunale militare di Pola fu asportato dal comando tedesco del Küstenland, mentre gli archivi relativi a territori ceduti alla Jugoslavia furono ad essa consegnati a seguito del trattato di pace del 1947: di parte del materiale consegnato si conserva il microfilm.

The conception of the Central Archives can be compared with that of the former General Archives of the German Jews (Gesamtarchiv der deutschen Juden) located in Berlin 1905- 1939. Storing and cataloguing historically valuable documents from Jewish communities, associations, organizations, and persons are of major concern. As a rule, the records are deposited at the Central Archives. ","holdings":"The collection of documents from the Jewish communities, associations, and organizations is limited to the political borders of the Federal Republic of Germany. None of the institutions though are obliged to transfer outdated records to the Central Archives, as the collection and storage itself is based on individual agreements. Contrary to the public sector, enforceable guidelines are non-existent in the Jewish sector; the Central Archives in Heidelberg merely offers the Jewish communities an opportunity to store old records and documents. Yet on this basis the Central Archives has already acquired extensive record groups:\r\n\r\nCentral Council of Jews in Germany\r\nRecords 1950-1997, 45 linear meters\r\nCentral Welfare Office of the Jews in Germany\r\nRecords 1954-1990, 110 linear meters\r\nAllgemeine Jüdische Wochenzeitung\r\nRecords of the Editor 1983-1997, 11 linear meters\r\nJewish Student Organisations\r\nRecords 1962-1992, 7 linear meters\r\nRegional Association of Jewish Communities in Lower Saxony / Jewish Community Hannover\r\nRecords 1945-1990, 45 linear meters\r\nRegional Association of Jewish Communities in Nordrhein\r\nRecords 1945-1981, 42 linear meters\r\nJewish Community Berlin\r\nDP-files 1945-1949, 5 linear meters\r\nJewish Community Bremen\r\nRecords 1945-1979, 42 linear meters\r\nJewish Community Dortmund\r\nRecords 1945-1990, 30 linear meters\r\nJewish Community Düsseldorf\r\nRecords 1945-1979, 21 linear meters\r\nJewish Community Frankfurt a.M.\r\nRecords 1945-1985, 302 linear meters\r\nJewish Community Fürth\r\nRecords1946-1995, 10 linear meters\r\nJewish Community Heidelberg\r\nRecords 1961-1991, 6 linear meters\r\nJewish Community Wiesbaden\r\nRecords 1962-1986 and papers of the cantor Edmund Capell 1905 - 1937, 6 linear meters\r\nPersona\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve a detailed documentation on Jewish life, the Central Archives also looks into personal papers. Historically relevant sources are not only to be found among the leading representatives of Jewish communites and organizations but also among a new generation of Jewish authors in German literature and journalism. Already in their lifetime important documents can be secured and given public access. The prerequisite for the cooperation with a Jewish author is that the author deals with Jewish topics that have an impact on public discussions in the Federal Republic of Germany. Documents of the following persons are already in storage:\r\n\r\nJellinek\r\nfamily papers 1850-1960, 0.1 linear meter\r\nEdmund Capell (*1876-1942), cantor\r\npersonal papers, 0.02 linear meters\r\nLeiser Goldschmidt (*1889-1960)\r\npersonal papers, 0.01 linear meter\r\nLothar Rothschild (*1909-1974), rabbi\r\npersonal papers, 2 linear meters\r\nStefan Schwarz (*1910-1985)\r\npersonal papers, 0.02 linear meters\r\nJoseph Wulf (*1912-1974), historian\r\npersonal papers, 21 linear meters\r\nEmil Davidovic (*1912-1986), rabbi\r\npersonal papers, 0.3 linear meters\r\nHelmut Eschwege (*1913-1992), historian\r\npersonal papers, 13 linear meters\r\nKahn\r\nfamily papers 1915-1980, 0.02 linear meters\r\nGerhard Ballin (*1922-1989), genealogist\r\ncollection of material, 2 linear meters\r\nRobert Schindel (*1944), poet\r\nmanuscripts 1960-1991, 0.5 linear meters\r\nHenryk Broder (*1946), journalist\r\nmanuscripts and collection of material,\r\ntapes 1963-1993, 13 linear meters\r\nRafael Seligmann (*1947), author\r\narticles 1979-1984, 0.02 linear meters\r\nPeter Sichrovsky (*1947), author\r\ncritics and reader's letters 1983-1990, 0.4 linear meters\r\nSiegfried Baruch (*1901-1973)\r\nletters, fotos, articles 1948-1983, 0.1 linear meter\r\nBarbara Honigmann (*1949), author\r\ncritics 1986-1996, 1 linear meter\r\nCollections\r\nCemetery documentation\r\n\r\nNearly 2.000 Jewish cemeteries exist today in the Federal Republic of Germany. The total number of Jewish gravestones have been estimated at 600.000. Destruction, willful and by the elements, endanger these tombstones. A major task of the Central Archives in the first years of its existence was the preservation of the inscriptions by an extensive photo-documentary. Photographs of about 54.000 Jewish tombstones in Baden-Württemberg are now in possession of the Central Archives. In addition, the Central Archives stores photographs of more than 5.000 Jewish gravestones of Lower Saxony. Information on other documentation-projects of Jewish gravestone inscriptions is collected systematically.\r\nNewsletters\r\n\r\nThe collection of all periodical publications by Jewish groups or organizations is a further aim of the Central Archives in Heidelberg. Written newsletters that are sent, that is, \"made public\" to members of a Jewish community, association, or organization are considered publications. The collections of the Central Archives consist of public newspapers and journals, newsletters of Jewish communities, programs of Jewish adult education centers, and photocopied circulars.\r\n\r\nThe Central Archives systematically collects lists of sources kept in other archives, institutions, or of those in private possession that are of relevance to the history of the Jews in Germany. As a rule, existent special inventories are copied and given access to in Heidelberg.
