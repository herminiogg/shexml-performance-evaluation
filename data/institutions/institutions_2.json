The Institute’s name was changed to “Institute of Contemporary History” in 1952. Another decade later, in 1961, the institute assumed its current administrative and organizational structure as a foundation under public law. It is funded by the Federal Government and six of the German federal states and belongs to the Leibnitz Association, which affiliates 89 independent research institutions of all fields.\r\nUp to the 1970s, most of the research conducted by the Institute focused on National Socialism, the Weimar Republic and the occupation. Since then, however, the history of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic in their international context have been added to the research agenda.","holdings":"Along with the research departments, a library (over 225,000 volumes) and an archives were established to support the historians. From the beginning, the archives’ mission was to collect primary documents, to process and describe them and to make them accessible to the institute’s historians as well as external researchers. Especially in the first two decades, this was a rather cumbersome task, because the majority of state and other public records, which had been seized by the Allies in 1945, remained in the possession of the United States, Great Britain and Russia. \r\n\r\nWitness Accounts (Zeugenschrifttum) [ZS]: \r\nThe institute’s researchers tried to compensate this initial lack of official records by collecting documents from and about important individuals and interviewing eye witnesses, especially former military leaders and people who had opposed the National Socialist regime. These collections are subsumed in a group of collections known as “Zeugenschrifttum”. They consist of interviews, interrogation records, affidavits, memories, and correspondence. Consulting these records today, it should be kept in mind that they were usually created after 1945 and often served apologetic purposes.  Nonetheless, the collections contain valuable information that might not be found elsewhere. All ZS files have been digitized and almost all can be accessed digitally through the archives’ online database.\r\n\r\nState Records [mostly MA, a few ED]: \r\nEven though the IfZ is not responsible for the collection of public records, its archives nonetheless holds vast collections of state records from the Nazi-period. These do not consist of the original documents. Instead, they are composed of copies in paper and on microfilm which the IfZ acquired from the American National Archives before the original German records were turned over to the German Federal Archives in the 1960s. In addition, copies of German records were also procured from Great Britain, the Netherlands as well as some Central Eastern European countries, especially Poland and Czechoslovakia. The collections include records of almost all important state provenances of the German Empire between 1933 and 1945 as well as records of the NSDAP and her organizations. \r\n\r\nCourt Records [mostly G, some MA]: \r\nThe IfZ-Archives hold a nearly complete set of copies of the documents compiled during the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg and the various subsequent cases tried under Control Council law No. 10. The collection consist of minutes, exhibits, and compositions of the prosecution as well as the defense. In addition, copies of records of other important foreign court cases, such as the Eichmann-trial in Israel, are also part of this collection group. \r\nCopies of German court records can also be found at the IfZ. Among those are records of trials conducted against opponents and dissidents of the Nazi regime between 1933 and 1945, as well as records of proceedings against perpetrators conducted after the war.\r\n\r\nPersonal Papers [ED, very few MA]: \r\nIn addition to public records, the archives soon began to collect personal papers of individuals. Among the numerous collections are papers of former members of the German military, of members of the military and civilian resistance, as well as of victims of the National Socialist regime. In recent years, the archives began to collect papers of private people, for example documents of former Hitler Youth-members and correspondence of common soldiers with their families (Feldpost). \r\n\r\nPapers of Associations and Parties/Institutional Records [ED]: \r\nThe IfZ also collects records of smaller associations, parties and political or social movements, which do not maintain their own archives. \r\n\r\nTopical Collections [ED, very few MA]: \r\nPublic records, personal papers, and papers of associations and parties are complemented by topical collections compiled by researches, journalists and individuals.\r\n\r\nManuscripts [mostly MS]: \r\nThe archives’ manuscript-collection consists of memories, eye witness-reports and autobiographical material, scripts of radio and television broadcasts as well as theses and dissertations dealing with various aspects of National Socialism.\r\n\r\nMaps [Lk]\r\n\r\nPosters [P]","conditions":"The archives is available for public research.

Until 1985, they were a State service, whose operation was largely provided by the General Council (building, supplies). As of 1 January 1986, they became a departmental responsibility, placed under the full authority of the president of the general council, which became the departmental council in 2015.\r\n\r\nThe role of the Departmental Archives developed during the 19th and 20th centuries. Initially made up of the files of the administrations, jurisdictions and establishments of the Ancien Régime that were nationalised, they were extended to the archives of the administrations established in the department, to the archives of notaries, communes, hospitals, as well as to private archives...\r\n\r\nAmong the Ancien Régime documents, we deplore the disappearance of a large part of the archives of the former bishopric of Cahors, following a dispute over their fate, which arose around 1805 between Prefect Bailly, the first prefect of the Lot (March 1800 - December 1813), and Bishop Cousin de Grainville (bishop of Cahors from 1802 to 1828). There is also evidence of the \"burning\" of documents (feudal titles, old books, parchments, etc.) in 1792 and 1793.","mandates":"[Legislative framework](https://archives.lot.fr/r/33/cadre-legislatif/)","buildings":"The Departmental Archives are located in Cahors, the department's capital, and have been housed in the former Capuchin convent since 1921.

To a lesser extent it also considers the history of Terezín prior to the Second World War. The Memorial’s collections may be divided into four groups: written documents, pictorial material, three-dimensional items and works of art created by prisoners, and anti-war art by post-war and contemporary artists.\r\n\r\nThe foundations of the collections were laid by those items obtained from various institutions and former prisoners in connection with the creation of the first museum exhibition, which was opened in May 1949. It comprised primarily documents and objects brought from the Military Historical Institute in Prague. Care for the collections gained a firmer footing, however, only in 1960, when a professional member of staff was employed and the first inventory book drawn up. Initially the three-dimensional pieces and written material were looked after at the same site, which later became the foundation of the collections department. In 1965, the archive was separated from the collections department, and three years later the photographic was separated from the archive. The archive and photographic archive are now part of the Memorial's documentation department. The archival collections are not large, because by the time the Memorial had started to make acquisitions much evidence that would have been of interest had already been gathered in other archives, both in the Czech Republic and abroad (e.g. at the Jewish Museum in Prague, the State Central Archive in Prague and Yad Vashem in Jerusalem). The collections of the Terezín Memorial were built up primarily from items obtained as gifts or purchased from former prisoners (or their relatives), and to a lesser extent articles transferred from other institutions.\r\n\r\n*Collections of the Department of Documentation*\r\n\r\nThe Department of Documentation brings together both written source material (prison documentation, correspondence, manuscripts, private writings, the recollections of former prisoners) and pictorial material (photographs and postcards) relating mainly to the history of Terezín from its foundation to the year 1945. The greater part comprises material from the Second World War period coming from the concentration camp for Jews – the Terezín Ghetto, the Gestapo police prison in the Small Fortress at Terezín and the concentration camp at Litoměřice. A smaller part relates to the persecution of Czechoslovak citizens in other parts of the Nazi repression apparatus, e.g. at the Sachsenhausen, Buchenwald, Mauthausen, Auschwitz Flossenbürg and Dachau concentration camps and their branches.\r\n\r\nThe earlier history of Terezín (to 1939) is represented in the collections mainly by pictorial material (period postcards). At the end of January 2011 it contained 12,830 indexed items.\r\n\r\nA library is also available to researchers, where it is possible to study relevant professional literature. The department is based in the Small Fortress, in the “Mansion” building.\r\n\r\n*Collections of the Department of Collections*\r\n\r\nThe Department of Collections amasses primarily 3D objects and works of art. These include items relating to the persecution of the inmates (instruments of torture, weapons), their labour duty assignments (products made in the Ghetto workshops), their personal objects (prison clothes, dishes and cutlery), as well as objects created by the inmates during their free time activities (souvenirs, drawings, poems, sheet music). Covering items from all walks of the Ghetto’s cultural life – fine arts, music, arts and crafts, theater, literature including works by self-taught writers – the collection comprises paintings, drawings, musical scores, poems and illustrations. An important part of the collection is made up of documents relating to the cultural life in the Terezín Ghetto, primarily a representative set of memorial posters tracing the history of cultural activities in the Ghetto in the years 1941 – 1945. The periods of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy as well as World War I and World War II are represented in the collection by the militaria, army uniforms, medals, insignia and badges. As for the postwar era, this is illustrated predominantly by paintings, drawings and sculptures, works of art with anti-war and anti-fascist themes and artworks devoted to the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nAs of December 31, 2010, the fond of the Department of Collections had as many as 12,316 inventory numbers. Most collection items are kept in the building of the Small Fortress Museum, while works of art and sheet music written by composers imprisoned in the Terezín Ghetto are deposited in the former Magdeburg Barracks in Terezín.\r\n\r\nThe collections of the Terezín Memorial consist primarily of objects acquired by gift or purchase from the former inmates, eventually their relatives; to a smaller extent by transfer from other institutions.","openingTimes":"The archives of the Terezin Memorial in the Small Fortress is open to the public on workdays (Monday to Friday) between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. \r\n\r\nResearchers must send a request for permission to study in the archives or photo archives (archiv@pamatnik-terezin.cz).

The building was miraculously spared from the bombing in June 1944, so Calvados did not suffer the massive losses experienced by the neighbouring department of La Manche. On the other hand, many public services, notaries' offices and communes in the department lost their archives, as the departmental archivist René-Norbert Sauvage indicated in a 1949 report. The losses were particularly significant for certain notaries, for the municipal archives of Caen, which were destroyed along with the Town Hall, and for the archives of the tax departments, including the Hypothèques (for the districts of Caen, Lisieux, Pont-l'Evêque and Vire). On the other hand, funds were miraculously spared in disaster-stricken towns, such as the municipal archives of Lisieux.\r\n\r\nIn 1963, the departmental architect Léon Réme designed a new building for the Archives to the north of the campus. The building is typical of the archive towers of the time, taking into account the first national recommendations issued by the Archives de France.\r\n\r\nThe building on rue Saint-Laurent in Caen was demolished in 1966 to make way for the modern wing of the prefecture, the current headquarters of the department.   \r\nAn extension was designed in 1992 with a second storage tower.

In the Vosges, as in many other departments, the archives were initially kept in the premises of the Prefecture: in the former Jesuit college, now the Ecole du Centre, and then in the premises of the current Prefecture built in 1828. In 1808, a fire spared the archives, but they were nevertheless downgraded when they were temporarily evacuated. In 1841, the filing system was improved, even though it did not follow the 1817 standards, by derogation of the Minister of the Interior. \r\nSuccessive archivists endeavoured to complete, classify and preserve the collections in the most suitable premises possible. The oldest document preserved in the Vosges is the charter of Adalberon II, bishop of Metz and brother of Thierry I, Duke of Lotharingia, dating from 985. This diploma from the abbey of Senones, listed as 2 H 1, confirms the abbey's possession of the church of Vacqueville (today in Meurthe-et-Moselle) and its dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe departmental archives then had to suffer from conflicts. The Franco-Prussian war of 1870-1871 caused administrative complications with the fluctuation of the border, leading to the extraction of documents from the archives by the German authorities, which was only resolved after the First World War. The First World War led to the removal of 70 boxes of the most valuable archives to Montpellier. Many documents were destroyed in the communes following the occupations. The Second World War had the same effects: archives were moved and destroyed in the communes. In particular, the archives of the tribunal de grande instance of Saint-Dié, two departments of the Prefecture, the Inspection académique, and most of the war damage files from the First World War disappeared.\r\n\r\nFor the departmental archives of the Vosges, the post-war period was a time of blossoming. The collection continued actively, so much so that the premises of the Prefecture, despite renovations, had to be supplemented by an annex in the former chapel of the Franciscans in Épinal, and then by another in Golbey. From the mid-1970s onwards, the number of staff increased. Even before the decentralisation, the General Council undertook the creation of a new building in La Voivre. Work began in 1986 and the new home of the Departmental Archives opened its doors on 18 April 1988. This building was used to store the 14 linear kilometres of collections that existed at the time. Decentralisation accelerated the growth of the team, which reached 18 people in 1991 and 27 by 2011.","mandates":"https://archives.vosges.fr/presentation/missions-des-archives-departementales","buildings":"The building of the Vosges departmental archives was not always the one we know today, nor even the building of the Prefecture that the oldest readers of the Archives knew.\r\nIf, as soon as the departmental archives were created in 1796, the departmental archivist demanded space because the Jesuit college which housed the archives at that time was too small, it was not until 1828 and the construction of the current Prefecture that a wing was dedicated to housing the archives and its staff. \r\nThis was followed by a period of renovations and internal moves to accommodate the increasingly \"invasive\" archives. In the 1970s and 1980s, storage annexes were created to complete the existing capacities, which were still insufficient in the face of the evolution of the administration and administrative production. \r\nFinally, the La Voivre building was built and inaugurated in 1988.

Thus, from 1841 onwards, a classification framework, i.e. a common method of filing documents, was gradually introduced. As for personnel, the most important measure for the network was the decision in 1850 to place at the head of each repository an archivist trained at the Ecole nationale des Chartes, created in 1821.\r\n\r\nFor more than two hundred years, the institution has continued its work of collecting and preserving public and private archival documents. Its missions have expanded considerably and have also adapted to changes in the administration and the needs of the public. The decentralisation laws of 1982 made local authorities the owners of their archives, thus leading to the transfer of the maintenance of the buildings and the management of the personnel of the departmental archives to the general and then departmental councils.\r\n\r\nFor almost a century, the departmental archives were annexes to the prefectures. This was the case for the Bouches-du-Rhône Archives, which occupied premises in the Prefecture and then in the annex on rue Saint-Sébastien (6th arrondissement) until 2006.\r\n\r\nIn the Bouches-du-Rhône, the importance of the town of Aix-en-Provence, the seat of the main civil and religious institutions of Provence under the Ancien Régime, led to some of the archives being housed in an annex. At the request of the notables of Aix, the Ministry of Public Education appointed an archivist around 1884, thereby firmly establishing the division of the archives between two sites. In 2016, the Departmental Council took the decision to bring together all the collections in Marseille, the transfer of which was completed in 2018.","records":"They are organised in such a way as to respect the separation between public and private archives. Within the public collections, the presentation follows a traditional chronological logic between ancient, revolutionary, modern and contemporary archives.

Since the 15th century, the Bernese archives have been housed in the vaults of the town hall. In 1713 a permanent archive commission was set up. The archives of the perished city and Republic of Bern went to the newly created Canton of Bern in 1803, and partly to the Cantons of Aargau and Vaud. Until 1891, the administration of the National Archive was the responsibility of the respective state scribe.\r\n\r\nIn archiving terms, the first twenty years of this century has seen the State Archive make considerable advances. The introduction of an archive information system (2005), the publication of all the directory units in the online inventory and online access to specialist library holdings (2009) have made it possible to conduct research throughout the Archive’s holdings from anywhere in the world at any time. The Cantonal Parliament’s adoption of the Archiving Act (2009) and its entry into force along with the related ordinance on 1 January 2010 was a very important milestone for the State Archive. The new legislation codified archiving tasks for the first time in a cantonal act in line with the law on freedom of information and data protection and laid down principles for the more efficient organisation of archiving work. The law also gave electronic documents an equivalent status to documents on paper, thus defining digital archiving as a new task.\r\n\r\nBased on these new legal principles, the Cantonal Parliament decided on 1 September 2014 to begin a comprehensive programme of digital records and process management and archiving (DGA), at the same time approving the funding required for the 2015–2022 period. You will find more information on this trendsetting project here.","buildings":"Before moving to the Falkenplatz in 1939/40, the State Archive of the Canton of Bern was housed in the vaults of the Rathaus from the early 15th century.\r\n\r\nIt was Robert Grimm, Bern’s building director and a member of the Swiss parliament at the time, who proposed giving the archive a new home in a new building in the Länggasse district. The construction work was carried out by the renowned architect Walter von Gunten.\r\n\r\nAround 45 years later, between 1984-1986, a four-storey underground cultural heritage shelter, designed by architect Magdalena Rausser, was constructed at the same location.\r\n\r\nUntil the late 19th century, the Cantonal Chancellor was responsible for supervising the holdings in the State Archive. In 1891 Prof. Heinrich Türler was appointed the first full-time state archivist, a post he held from 1892 to 1914. Subsequent heads of the State Archive have been: Gottlieb Kurz (1914-1936), Dr. Rudolf v. Fischer (1914-1962), Fritz Häusler (1962-1982), Dr. Karl F. Wälchli (1982-1999) and Prof. Dr. Peter Martig (1999-2012). Since March 2012, Dr. Barbara Studer Immenhauser has been in charge of the State Archive. Today, even though it is at a different location, the State Archive is still closely linked to the State Chancellery in administrative and organisational terms.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, various structural measures have been carried out to modernise the State Archive at its Falkenplatz location; these include a new photo archive room, a new air-conditioning system, the refurbishment of the reading room and conference rooms, and an extension to the cafeteria, installation of a photovoltaic system on the roof. In May 2014 the State Archive opened an external stockroom, adjacent to its main premises.","holdings":"The State Archive of the Canton of Bern curates archival materials that are worth preserving as records of the history of the Canton of Bern from the Middle Ages to the present day.

It preserves the archives of the state entities before 1803, acquires private archives of historical importance and promotes historical research in the canton. It runs the archive service for municipalities as a company.\r\n\r\nThe State Archives ensure\r\n- that legal and property claims can be asserted at any time on the basis of original documents. It thus makes a decisive contribution to legal security in the canton;\r\n- that parliament, government and administration as well as the courts always have access to documents produced in the past.

Thanks to the dynamism of the director René Robinet and the inventiveness of the departmental architect Jean-Robert Dupré, the new headquarters of the Archives used the most modern construction techniques and its inauguration on 10 November 1957 was an event of international renown.\r\n\r\nFrom the 1970s onwards, however, the need for an extension was felt in order to meet new needs: an increase in the number of visitors (notably with the arrival of a new school population), an increase in staff... The extension of the building was therefore carried out by two Parisian architects, Bernard Feypell and Edward Zoltowski, and two thirds of the cost was financed by the department, which became the new supervisory authority for the service on 1 January 1986 following decentralisation.\r\n\r\nToday, the building continues to house the archives of all the public services of the Ardennes, as well as the private collections of individuals, companies and associations. A team of 18 people work to preserve and communicate nearly 17 kilometres of documents, always trying to postpone the date of saturation of the premises. These premises are undergoing major changes, linked to the development of information and communication technologies.\r\n\r\nOn 10 November 2007, these premises, which house the written memory of the department and the staff responsible for its conservation, celebrated their fiftieth anniversary. To mark the occasion, the Departmental Archives put on an exhibition looking back at the three key stages in the construction and fitting out of the building.","holdings":"For general information on the holdings of the archive, please click [here](http://archives.cg08.fr/article.php?larub=18&titre=presentation-des-fonds).","openingTimes":"The reading room is open Tuesday to Friday from 9 am to 5 pm, closed on Mondays.\r\n\r\nDocuments are released in lifts, one every half hour, with a limit of three documents per lift.

Given the late creation of the department by Napoleon I in 1808, Tarn-et-Garonne did not have a departmental archive until 1810.\r\n\r\nOver the following decades, this new service set about recovering and collecting the titles and papers from the administrations and religious institutions abolished by the Revolution. Since that time, too, the Departmental Archives have been controlling and collecting the archives of public administrations operating within the department for historical purposes. Where necessary, donations and deposits of private documents complete this vast and ever-growing deposit of documents.\r\n\r\nThe Departmental Archives have been housed since 1902 in a former teacher training college built between 1875 and 1877 on the initiative of the Departmental Council. However, from 1905 to 1927, part of the premises (the western wing) was reserved for the assisted children's service, and then, until 1978, for the tuberculosis clinic. At the end of the 1950s, a wave of work modernised the Archives by installing self-supporting structures and metal shelving. In 1978, the Archives moved into the last wing of the building, after the departure of the dispensary.\r\n\r\nThe department holds archives dating back to the 9th century. The Moissac abbey collection, preserved from the Middle Ages to the French Revolution, contains the oldest document in the repository (847) and is of interest to the history of the South-West, as are the papers of the powerful Armagnac family, including the \"Saume\" of Isle-Jourdain, an enormous register containing copies made in the 17th century of documents dating from the 9th to the 16th centuries.\r\n\r\nThe series of notarial archives (5E) begins in the 12th century and represents more than 1,700 linear metres of registers and bundles until the 19th century.

During the Second World War, the Political Archive was involved in raids of the archives of other countries’ foreign ministries which took place up to summer 1940. The seized files were all returned, at the latest by the end of the war.\r\n\r\n1936 saw a further organisational reform, followed by the mass handover of files from the missions abroad in light of the danger of war following the annexation of the Sudetenland in 1938. This saturated the capacity of the Political Archive and forced more archive material to be transferred to the Reich Archives.\r\n\r\nIn 1943, archive director Johannes Ulrich (1902 – 1965), who had close ties to the national conservative resistance, initiated the process of evacuating the holdings of the Political Archive to palaces in the Harz mountains. The holdings that were moved included all documentation for the period up to 1920 and most of the material from 1920 to 1936. However, as they were being transported a large part of the classified files and parts of the documents from this period belonging to the Cultural Directorate-General were burned in a fire due to an accident.\r\n\r\nMost of the files from the period from 1936 onwards which had still been needed for business ongoing in 1943 fell victim to bombs or, in the last few months of the war, deliberate destruction of Foreign Office premises.  The losses cannot be precisely described – however,  they affected in particular: files from the Political Directorate-General on countries with which the German Empire still maintained diplomatic relations in 1943;     files from the Office of the Reich Minister (which in any case have been partly preserved on microfilm); personnel files of officials still active in 1943.\r\n\r\nThe evacuation sites of the Political Archive were not directly impacted by the war. In April 1945 the order was given to destroy the classified files, but the archivists working at the relevant locations delayed carrying it out, meaning losses were minimal. In the end predominantly archive material of the following provenance were incinerated: Political Directorate-General I Military; Trade Policy Division; the Embassy in Paris.\r\nThe Western Allies salvaged the contents of the Political Archive stored in other locations, amalgamated them with Foreign Office files found in Berlin as well as material from other sources (including the Reich Chancellery) and transferred them to Whaddon Hall in Great Britain in 1948. A selection from the archives were filmed and it is still possible to request duplicates of the films from the United States National Archives. The Oxford and Kent catalogues were compiled using the collection of material available with the help of old descriptive lists, and they served as the primary finding aids for the records until 1945. Eventually, work began on the edition “Akten zur deutschen auswärtigen Politik 1918–1945” (ADAP) [“Files on German Foreign Policy, 1918-1945”].\r\nOverall, the Foreign Office archive material stored in the Reich Archives did not suffer any major war losses. The archives were safeguarded by the Soviet Union along with segments of the remaining office files from Foreign Office premises in Berlin and elsewhere, and they were transferred to the German Central Archives in Potsdam up to 1960. Remains of this archive material from the former Legal Directorate-General are still in the Special Archive of the Russian State Military Archive in Moscow or have gone missing.\r\n\r\nIn 1951, the Western Allies gave the Federal Republic of Germany the personnel and budget files which were needed in order to set up the new Federal Foreign Office. The Political Archive was reinstated as a division in order to to enable these files to be archived. By 1959, the remaining archive material had been transported to Bonn on the basis of an agreement concluded in 1956, and since then they have been fully accessible for research purposes. German historians participated, on an equal footing, in running the ADAP publication project.\r\n\r\nThe files of missions abroad left behind after 1938 had been either destroyed or confiscated by their host country when war broke out against Germany and/or at the end of the war. Nearly all of the files impounded since 1951 were returned, but the records offices of some missions abroad are still located in institutions belonging to foreign countries.\r\nAfter 1951 the Political Archive initially served as a selective archive which sought to store only files from the new Federal Foreign Office which were truly worthy of being retained. Just as in 1920, the systematic collection of material to be archived began with files from the political directorates-general. In order to fully unburden the registries of old files, a separate registry was set up and it was not merged with the Political Archive until 1968. Previously, due to space constraints, it had primarily destroyed files from the early 1950s from country divisions within the Economic Directorates-General.\r\n\r\nThe records centre was set up in 1972 as a comprehensive repository in which all files submitted from Germany are stored before being processed and allocated to the archive which corresponded to their provenance. A second comprehensive repository was set up for the archive material from the missions abroad. Work on processing the contents of the final archive began in earnest in the 1980s. In connection with this, the files from the Zentrale Rechtsschutzstelle [central legal protection office], which had been part of the Federal Foreign Office from 1953 to 1970, were handed over to the Federal Archives.\r\n\r\nThe edition of ADAP was concluded in 1995. At the same time, on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office, the Munich/Berlin Institute of Contemporary History (IfZ) started publishing the “Akten zur Auswärtigen Politik der Bundesrepublik Deutschland” [Files on the Foreign Policy of the Federal Republic of Germany – “AAPD”]. This annual publication presents the events which took place 30 years previously, the first edition on the year 1963 was released in 1993.\r\n\r\nIn 1951, an administrative archive to temporarily store files was set up in the Ministerium für Auswärtige Angelegenheiten der DDR [Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the GDR – “MfAA”]. It obtained the status of “Endarchiv” [final archive], independent of the GDR’s state archive administration in 1966. Ultimately, the archive became responsible for: open files from the MfAA headquarters and missions abroad; formerly classified files opened for public use; interministerial agreements between the GDR and other countries.\r\n(Source: http://www.archiv.diplo.de/Vertretung/archiv/en/05-Ueber-das-Archiv/5-1-geschichte.html)","holdings":"Among others contains restitution- and/or compensation-related materials: Auswärtiges Amt; archive holds \"global agreement files;\" closed files","openingTimes":"Monday to Thursday: 08:30 am to 04:30 pm\r\nFriday: 08:30 am to 03:00 pm ","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[52.51253,13.40137]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"de","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de-002447","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de-002447/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de"},"meta":{"subitems":47,"updated":"2023-03-20T10:30:25.074Z"}},{"id":"de-002558","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Staatsarchiv Hamburg","parallelFormsOfName":["Hamburg State Archives"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Kattunbleiche 19","city":"Hamburg","region":"Hamburg","postalCode":"22041","country":"Germany","countryCode":"DE","email":["office-staatsarchiv@staatsarchiv.hamburg.de"],"telephone":["040 428 31-3200"],"fax":["040 428 31-3201"],"url":["http://www.hamburg.de/staatsarchiv/"]},"history":"The Hamburg State Archives (Staatsarchiv Hamburg) was founded 300 years ago.

Since 1941 it was known as the State Archive of Rivne Oblast, then in 1958 renamed to the Rivne Oblast State Archive. From 1980 it was known as the State Archive of Rivne Oblast again.","holdings":"The most ancient documents are the purchase deeds of XVI century on parchment that are kept in the Dubno district court fund, and two hand-written books - \"Sluzhebnyk\" and \"Psalter\" of the same period.\r\n\r\nThe main part of the archives documents is comprised of documents pertaining to the period when the region was a part of Russian Empire (1796-1917). First of all, these are the documents of local self-governments: the city council of Dubno, town councils and boards, documents of povit courts and courts of the peace, police headquarters, Land Surveying Commissions, educational establishments, where is the information about social and economic situation of the regional population, development of handicraft and trade.\r\n\r\nThe funds of establishments, enterprises and organizations of the Polish state period (1921-1939) include documents of county headquarters and departments, town and municipality governments, police establishments, the Rivne county court and prosecutor's office, land and financial establishments. The condition of social and political life of the Rivne region is completely represented in these documents. Fund documents of district village headquarters and their departments contain statistical information about the work of industrial enterprises, about the amount of population, schools, libraries; lists of landowners, registry book organizations, economic characteristics of districts, road maps and others.\r\n\r\nSome documents reflect the activity of social, political and public organizations, such as \"Prosvita\", \"Soyuz Ukrainok\", \"Soyuz striltsiv Volynskoho ukrainskoho obyednannia\" the club \"Ridna Khata\", Polish and Jewish organizations and others.\r\n\r\nInteresting documents are found in the collections of Rivne branch of emigration syndicate (1929-1939), in the \"Local Committee of Polish Biographical Dictionary\", and in the \"Volhynia Voivodship Union of Polish Teachers\".\r\n\r\nThe only personal fund of Polish period is the fund of Jacob Hoffman, historian, regional ethnographer, deputy of Polish Seym, head of the Volhynia voivodship union of Polish teachers, author of \"Guide-book Around Volhynia\", and editor of the almanac \"Volyn Rechnyk\". In this fund you can famaliarize yourself with Hoffman biography, diaries, ethnographic records of his speeches in Seym. Also of great interest are programmes for the studying of Polish history and Polish language, manuscripts of articles about the history of political parties, reports about excavations in the Volhynia region.\r\n\r\nThe documents of Soviet establishments and organizations of the period of 1919-1920; 1939-1941 are represented by the funds of the Dubno district executive committee, district, town and municipality Revolutionary Committees, the funds of Provisional government in Rivne and executive committees of local councils.\r\n\r\nInformation contained in documents of the WW II period and occupation of the Rivne region by Nazis (1941-1944) is used very actively in these archives.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, these are documents of Rivne district government, district commissariats, Rivne burgomaster, some municipal and district governments, state employment agencies, social and political and public organizations (\"District Association Prosvita\"; \"Ukrainian Publishing House of the Newspaper \"Volyn\", \"Rivne Church Government\" and others).\r\n\r\nThey tell us about the activity of occupied administration establishments, about their functions, about the organization of ghetto, the existence of concentration camps; they contain information about trade and industrial institutions, companies, schools, about the population and its distribution according to the age and sex, lists of inhabitants, lists of workers of different institutions; information about citizens' exporting forced labour to Germany. The investigation files of Security Service of Ukraine in the Rivne region, collection of letters from citizens sent to Germany for forced labour also tell us about the events of this period.\r\n\r\nAmong the unique documents of this period there is the \"Collection of Documents of OUN-UPA (Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists-Ukrainian Insurgent Army)\"; this collection contained editions of resolutions, conferences and conventions of \"Great Assembly\" of OUN, originals of orders, reports, reviews of various commanders of subsections of UPA \"Polissya Sich\" under the command of Taras Bulba-Borovets, of the group \"North\" under the command of Klym Savur, as well as diaries of participants of those events.\r\n\r\nThe documents of the fund of underground district committee of Comunist Party tell about partisan and underground movement in Rivne region during the WW II.\r\n\r\nAll the documents of the occupation period are declassified.\r\n\r\nThe post-war period (1944-2007) is most extensively represented in the archive. These are the documents of the executive committee of Rivne oblast councils of deputies, their departments and government; of regional executive committees of village councils, large industrial enterprises, collective farms, educational establishments and public organizations. The funds of industrial enterprises in the Rivne region, health protection institutions, education, science, culture and others are included among these documents.\r\n\r\nThe archive also contains private funds of the participants of revolution events, Rivne region participants of partisan movement of famous writers, journalists and others.\r\n\r\nDocumentary photographs in the archives reflect the main period of Rivne regional history. The largest is the collection of documentary photographs where the famous persons of region are depicted, among them outstanding workers of agriculture, social and cultural sphere, builders, delegates of convention, vaterans of work and war. There are many photos of partisan and undeground struggles in the Rivne region during the WW II (mainly photoreproductions and photoprints).\r\n\r\nAmong the phonodocuments are the recorded memories of partisans-scouts and undeground workers, releases from the information bureau about the Rivne region, reports from the \"places of grand events\", information about amateur artists and performers and others.\r\n\r\nTotal Volume of Funds:\r\n4069 funds, 1064185 collection items (1774-2007).\r\n2981 collection items of scientific and technical documentation (1949-1978).\r\n7 collection items of film documents (1944-1978).\r\n13979 collection items of photo documents (1917-2007).\r\n136 collection items of sound recordings (1967-2008).\r\n5 collection items of video documents (2006-2008).","openingTimes":"The reading room is open Monday till Thursday 9am - 6:15pm, Friday  9am - 5pm","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[50.62486,26.2522]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"ua","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/ua-003329","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/ua-003329/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/ua"},"meta":{"subitems":32,"updated":"2023-03-12T13:39:48.325Z"}},{"id":"fr-006203","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Archives départementales de la Somme","parallelFormsOfName":["Departmental Archives of the Somme"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"61 rue Saint-Fuscien  ","city":"Amiens","region":"Hauts-de-France","postalCode":"80000","country":"France","countryCode":"FR","email":["archives@somme.fr"],"telephone":["+33 (0)3.60.03.49.50"],"fax":["+33 3.60.03.49.59"],"url":["https://archives.somme.fr/"]},"history":"Created in 1796, the Departmental Archives carry out missions defined by the decentralisation law of 22 July 1983 and the law on archives of 15 July 2008.

Despite an attempt in 1793 to bring them together in a single repository, the colony's archives went through many vicissitudes before being placed under the responsibility of the colonial controller by the organic order of 21 August 1825. The archives were then transferred for more than a century to a building of the colonial control, rue de l'intendance (today rue Amiral Lacaze).\r\n\r\nOn 5 September 1861, the General Council re-established the post of colonial archivist, entrusted to a retired assistant commissioner of the navy, Marcel Voïart. Filing and sorting were carried out until the post was abolished in 1906, leaving the archives abandoned. In 1919, the curator of the Léon Dierx museum, Adrien Merlo, was appointed curator-archivist. After his death, the functions of \"archivist-curator of the Léon Dierx museum, colonial librarian\" were combined in the person of Eugène Massinot.\r\n\r\nTo cope with the clutter of the premises, Governor Truitard decided to build a new building, at the corner of Rue Jean Châtel and Rue Roland Garros, to house the colonial archives and library. The transfer of the archives took place in 1939 in a state of great confusion. \r\n\r\nWith the departmentalization, the metropolitan legislation on departmental and communal archives was extended to the overseas departments by decree of 28 June 1948. The first departmental archivist, Yves Pérotin, took up his post in 1952. The saturation of the premises led to the multiplication of annexes, before a new building was delivered in 1971, on rue Hippolyte Foucque in Le Chaudron.\r\n\r\nThe Departmental Archives are now housed in Champ-Fleuri (4 rue Marcel Pagnol - Sainte-Clotilde) in a building designed by architects Pierre Noailly and Alain Bocquée, which was inaugurated in 2001.

Dr Alfred Wiener, a German Jew, having fought in WWI, returned to Germany in 1919 and was horrified at the surge of right-wing antisemitism, which blamed Jews for the defeat. Dr Wiener worked with the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith to combat antisemitism, writing, lobbying and speaking publicly. From 1925 (the year Hitler published Mein Kampf) he perceived a greater threat from the Nazi Party than any other antisemitic group or party. Under his influence an archive was started just to collect information about the Nazis, which formed the basis of campaigns to undermine their activities.Dr Wiener and his family fled Germany in 1933 and settled in Amsterdam. Dr Wiener's archive is believed to have been destroyed. Later that year he set up the Central Jewish Information Office at the request of the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Anglo-Jewish Association. The JCIO essentially continued the work of the earlier archive. Following the November Pogrom of 1938, Wiener prepared to bring his collection to the UK. It arrived the following summer and is believed to have opened on the day the Nazis invaded Poland.Throughout the War the JCIO served the British Government as it fought the Nazi regime. Increasingly the collection was referred to as‘Dr Wiener's Library' and eventually this led to its renaming. Post-war, the Library assisted the prosecutors at the Nuremberg Trial, amassed early survivor testimony and helped to shape the emerging academic study of the Holocaust.","mandates":"The Wiener Holocaust Library is a non-profit making company limited by guarantee. https://wienerholocaustlibrary.org/who-we-are/trustees/","administrativeStructure":"https://wienerholocaustlibrary.org/who-we-are/staff/","holdings":"The Wiener Holocaust Library has been collecting material related to the Holocaust, its causes and legacies since 1933.

In 1902 they were transferred to the new prefecture, rue des Combes. In 1958, the chapel of the former seminary, known as the Annexe de la Règle, was added to these premises. In 1948, the microfilming laboratory was created, which is now replaced by the photography and digitisation workshop.\r\n\r\nThe current building of the Departmental Archives, allée Alfred-Leroux, was inaugurated on 22 February 1985. With a storage capacity double that of the previous premises (25 linear kilometres), it was the first building to be built by the General Council following decentralisation and provided readers and archivists with modern working conditions that complied with standards.\r\n\r\nAfter 30 years of operation, the building was reaching saturation point. With some 400 linear metres of material being added each year, it became essential to extend the existing building. To meet this challenge, the Department launched a vast project in 2017 to build two additional wings connected by lifts to the original building.\r\n\r\nWith respectively 8 and 9 new floors in each wing (7 of which are entirely dedicated to conservation), this extension of the shops allows the passage from 22.5 km of storage space to 39.5 km.\r\nToday, the results are visible at the Departmental Archives: a new façade now insulates and embellishes the building and the public reception areas have been completely renovated and brought up to accessibility standards.","mandates":"https://archives.haute-vienne.fr/venir/qui-sommes-nous-/nos-missions","records":"Archival documents are generally not classified according to a thematic logic, as is most often the case in libraries, but according to their origin, i.e. the person or organisation that produced the archives. \r\nFind more info [here](https://archives.haute-vienne.fr/venir/sorienter-dans-les-fonds-darchives)","holdings":"https://archives.haute-vienne.fr/venir/qui-sommes-nous-/histoire-des-collections","openingTimes":"The Departmental Archives are currently open to the public on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays from 8.30 am to 5 pm without interruption.","reproductionServices":"The reproduction and research of documents can be carried out either by the departmental archives or, under certain conditions, by you in the reading room. \r\n\r\nIt is possible to [order reproductions](https://archives.haute-vienne.fr/venir/informations-pratiques-3/consulter-reproduire-et-reutiliser-des-documents/reproduction-et-recherche-de-documents/par-correspondance) which will be made by the service in the form of photocopies, photographic prints or digital files, depending on the type of original medium and the user's request.

Very early on, the Velay region was concerned with the classification and conservation of archives, both in the royal administration and among the ecclesiastics: in 1485, Canon Sigaud is mentioned as being the custodian of the archives of the cathedral chapter.\r\nThe first building used for the conservation of the Haute-Loire Archives was the former Capuchin convent purchased by the departmental administration in 1791. Arcis, the first departmental archivist, was appointed that same year. Then came Auguste Aymard, who was responsible for the creation of the repository from 1840 onwards and for the first filing of archives.\r\n\r\nAfter having passed through several premises, the Departmental Archives moved in 1988 to a new building designed by the architects V. Besançon and the Arsène brothers. Besançon and the Arsène Henry brothers. These new premises offer better working conditions for both the public (reading room, inventories and exhibitions) and the staff.\r\nDependent on the State until the decentralisation laws of 1982, the Departmental Archives became a department of the Department under the scientific and technical control of the Inter-ministerial Service of the Archives of France (Ministry of Culture).","openingTimes":"The reading room is open from Monday to Thursday from 9 am to 12.30 pm and from 1.30 pm to 5 pm, and on Friday from 9 am to 12.30 pm.

Therefore, in 1892, the Archives were moved to the Hôtel des Monneyroux, the current headquarters of the Conseil Général. However, this historic building was not well suited to the growing number of 20th century archives, so in 1959 the Archives were moved to a building in the rue de l'ancienne mairie, which combined an 18th century hotel with purpose-built archive storage facilities. The latter were also slowly saturated by the influx of archives, and so the question of moving arose thirty years later.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, the Conseil Général de la Creuse bought the former offices and warehouses of the Coopérateurs de la Creuse to install the Archives Départementales.

It was established in 2004 and is now based in Lviv, Ukraine.  \r\n\r\nThe Center’s work has several objectives: to research the history of Eastern and Central European cities; to promote urban history in an interdisciplinary format; to foster international academic and cultural exchange; to deepen knowledge and understanding of the complexity and diversity of history and heritage in Eastern and Central European cities; and to enhance cooperation among local and international institutions.\r\n\r\nOur research focuses are connected with the history and historical experiences in the cities in Eastern and Central Europe, including their spatial, social, and cultural transformations and everyday practices. Our research projects look at the history of Lviv, but also include the history of other cities and towns of the region in order to bring a comparative perspective and contextualize historically contemporary discussions and developments. Our research studies lie in such areas as “Cities, Wars, and Recoveries in 20th Century Eastern Europe” or “Urban Heritages: Concepts, Practices and Legacies”.\r\n\r\nOne of the examples of our engagement with urban heritage on both scholarly and practical levels is how our 2008 international conference, \"Jewish Urban Heritage and History in East-Central Europe\" sparked an initiative to commemorate and mark sites of Jewish history and heritage in Lviv. Over several years, it developed into <a href=\"https://www.lvivcenter.org/en/public-en/spatial/space-of-synagogues/\">\"The Space of Synagogues\"</a>, which includes projects to conserve and mark the sites of two synagogues and a beth hamidrash in Lviv. This project was realized in cooperation with the Lviv City Council and the German Organization for International Cooperation (GIZ). \r\n\r\nAmong other examples of cross-institutional cooperation was the <a href=\"https://reherit.org.ua/en/about-us-en/\">ReHerit project</a>, which resulted in several initiatives dealing with cultural heritage in Lviv, Uman and 10 other regions across Ukraine, or the <a href=\"https://www.lvivcenter.org/en/public-en/spatial/open-heritage/\">OpenHeritage (Horizon 2020) project</a>, identifying and testing the best practices of adaptive heritage re-use in Europe. ","generalContext":"Lviv and other cities and towns in the region of East-Central Europe. \r\n","holdings":"Archival holdings and some of the research materials of the Center are available through two digital projects: Urban Media Archive and Lviv Interactive. \r\n\r\nAlthough not specialized in Holocaust studies, these projects could offer a number of materials on Lviv and other cities and towns in the region of East-Central Europe. \r\n\r\nUrban Media Archive consists of digitized or digital-born collections of photos, films, videos, maps and oral history interviews that cover various topics related to the history of the 19th-20th century in East-Central Europe. The materials of the UMA come from various holdings: private collections, family archives, state institutions and other establishments. They were collected since the beginning of the Center for Urban History as a part of the research projects of our institution and represent our key interests. The annotated collections are available online at <a href=\"https://uma.lvivcenter.org/\">uma.lvivcenter.org</a>. Additionally, the collections that are digitized but not yet described and published are available offline at the access point at the library of the CUH.\r\n\r\n<p>The photographic holdings are the biggest part of the Urban Media Archive that represent the urban life of the cities from the late 19th century till now. As our institution is sited in Lviv the images of this city are dominant in our collection. Another part of the Urban Media Archive consists of moving images of different formats, mostly created in the second half of the 20th century. The digitized archive of Lviv Television covers the news programs released during the 1960s and 1970s. The collection of digitized 8mm and 16mm films and VHS (home movies, amateur films, video documentation) is the source of the history of everyday life, creative practices and public events in the region (1938-2008). </p><p>The collection of historical maps consists of over 200 high-resolution scans of city plans from the 17th  to 20th centuries. Among the cartographic materials of the Urban Media Archive, there is the <a href=\"https://uma.lvivcenter.org/en/maps/34480\">digitized scheme</a> that represents the resettlement of the Jewish population to the ghetto in 1941.</p> <p>Oral history interviews collected within research projects of the Center for Urban History are organized around topics related to the perception of space, professional biographies, and changes in urban space. The collection <a href=\"https://uma.lvivcenter.org/en/collections/125/interviews\">“Search for Home”</a> tells the stories of people from Pidzamche district, one of Lviv’s oldest districts, the place of the Jewish ghetto during World War II, and a site for postwar industrialization. Based on materials from towns and villages in Lviv, Ternopil, and Ivano-Frankivsk regions, the collection <a href=\"https://uma.lvivcenter.org/en/collections/142/interviews\">“Social Anthropology of filling the Void”</a> shows how the void was filled after representatives of social groups and ethnic communities were evicted by the violence during WWII and post-war changes.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Lviv Interactive <a href=\"http://lia.lvivcenter.org/\">(lia.lvivcenter.org)</a> is a digital encyclopedia about the city and its past. Its main idea is to study and visualize history through places and spaces. Since 2007, the project has produced over a thousand entries on the history of buildings, organizations and figures. The texts prepared by scholars are combined with maps, photographs, archival materials and interviews. Lviv Interactive is focused on the history of the city from the late nineteenth century to the present. The main thematic focuses of the project are the history of architecture, urban planning, heritage, and cultural and social history. </p><p>The history of WWII and the Holocaust is considerable but still one of several topics in the project. The digital nature and encyclopedia format of Lviv Interactive, however, allows the creation of a network of connections and interrelations between various stories that are included in the project. This way, the history of the Holocaust here is also enriched with an urban angle and local context. It is also connected to a general history of the Jewish community in Lviv.</p><p>\r\nAmong recent Holocaust-related publications, we prepared the history of <a href=\"https://lia.lvivcenter.org/en/events/pogrom/\">the pogrom in Lviv in 1941</a>, a map of the <a href=\"https://lia.lvivcenter.org/en/themes/janowska-camp/\">Janowska camp</a> (ZAL-L, DAW), or a map of the <a href=\"https://lia.lvivcenter.org/stalag328\">Soviet POW’s camp</a> in the city (Stalag 328). The stories of David Kahane, Leon Wells or Krystyna Chiger and her family show individual experiences and routes during the Holocaust in Lviv. We have also outlined the <a href=\"https://lia.lvivcenter.org/en/themes/reherit/holocaust-topography/\">Holocaust topography</a> in the city and the multiplicity of <a href=\"https://lia.lvivcenter.org/en/themes/reherit/behavior-holocaust/\">reactions to the Holocaust</a> among non-Jewish residents of Lviv.

In 1981, the original collection of testimonies was deposited at Yale University, and the Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies opened its doors to the public the following year (for a more detailed history of the collection see <a href=\"http://web.library.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/local_to_global.pdf\">A Yale University and New Haven Community Project: From Local to Global</a>). Since then, the Fortunoff Archive has worked to record, collect, and preserve Holocaust witness testimonies, and to make its collection available to researchers, educators, and the general public.\r\n\r\nThe Fortunoff Archive currently holds more than 4,400 testimonies, which are comprised of over 10,000 recorded hours of videotape. Testimonies were produced in cooperation with 37 affiliated projects across North America, South America, Europe, and Israel, and each project maintains a duplicate collection of locally recorded videotapes.\r\n\r\nThe Fortunoff Archive and its affiliates recorded the testimonies of willing individuals with first-hand experience of the Nazi persecutions, including those in hiding, survivors, bystanders, resistants, and liberators. Testimonies are recorded in whatever language the witness prefers, and range in length from one-half hour to over 40 hours (recorded over several sessions).\r\n\r\nA group of interviewers in the New Haven area completed an eight-week training course in 1984, and continue to attend workshops. Training includes lectures by historians, required readings, critical viewing of testimonies, and in-depth discussion of our interviewing methodology, with the goal of teaching the interviewers to be empathic and highly informed listeners.  Fortunoff Archive representatives supervised and conducted the training at the affiliate project.\r\n\r\nFortunoff Archive's interviewing methodology stresses the leadership role of the witness in structuring and telling his or her own story. Questions are primarily used to ascertain time and place, or elicit additional information about topics already mentioned, with an emphasis on open-ended questions that give the initiative to the witness. The witnesses are the experts in their own life story, and the interviewers are there to listen, to learn, and to clarify.\r\n\r\nThe testimonies are cataloged in Yale’s online public access catalog and in OCLC, in an international bibliographic database. Each recording is indexed by geographic names and topics discussed during the interview, and keyword searches can be combined to locate specific witness profiles.\r\n\r\nThe Fortunoff Archive serves as a resource for other projects working to record witnesses to the Holocaust and other twentieth-century genocides.  The Fortunoff Archive consults for a variety of Holocaust-related organizations, including the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Museum of Jewish Heritage: A Living Memorial to the Holocaust, the Bergen Belsen Memorial and Museum, and the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin. The Video Archive has worked with organizations concerned with documenting genocides in Armenia, Bosnia, and Cambodia, and with Japanese-Americans interned in the United States during World War II. The Archive has advised these groups on matters including confidentiality and legal issues, pre-interview procedures, interviewing techniques and the taping environment, and cataloging methods.","administrativeStructure":"The Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies is a collection within Yale University Library's Department of Manuscripts and Archives: http://web.library.yale.edu/mssa ","holdings":"More than 4,500 videotestimonies of Holocaust survivors, witnesses, and bystanders encompassing circa 12,000 hours of recorded material.

Documents from nationalised ecclesiastical establishments and suppressed establishments (guilds, colleges, etc.) were soon added, in accordance with the law of 5 November 1790 on the sale of national property. Later, the papers of the new administrations (departments, then prefectures, districts, courts, etc.) were added to this mass of documents.\r\n\r\nIn Brumaire Year 5 (October 1796), all these archives were brought together in the premises of the former Intendance. An archivist was appointed. This was the birth of the Departmental Archives. In 1800, the archives were placed under the responsibility of the prefect. \r\n\r\nIn July 1818, they were moved to the ground floor of the western wing of the \"new prefecture\", which had been installed in the premises of the former Visitation convent since 1805.\r\n\r\nDue to the small size and humidity of these premises, they were transferred in 1863 to the rooms on the first floor, which had previously been occupied by the municipal library. \r\n\r\nIn 1888, thanks to the perseverance of the archivist Charles Loizeau de Grandmaison, a specific \"stone and iron\" building was built between the square and the garden of the prefecture. Equipped with 2,600 metres of shelving, it was quickly saturated and the first floor of the prefecture was again requisitioned to house archives. \r\n\r\nDuring the 1939-1945 war, the archives were scattered throughout the department for safekeeping. In 1955, the Indre-et-Loire General Council voted the necessary funds to acquire land for the construction of a new archive building located near the Gallo-Roman rampart in Tours. Built by the architects Chalumeau and Barthélémy, the new eight-storey repository, designed to accommodate 15 linear kilometres of archives, was inaugurated on 6 December 1958.\r\n\r\nFrom the 1970s onwards, the new requirements linked to conservation needs and the increase in the mass of archives produced from the second half of the 20th century onwards made this building unsuitable for its function. On 19 December 1984, the General Council decided to build a centre dedicated to contemporary archives and local history in the commune of Chambray-lès-Tours, on the outskirts of Tours. It was equipped with 23 linear kilometres of shelving and a land reserve was set aside to allow for future extensions to the building.","records":"https://archives.touraine.fr/page/que-trouver-aux-archives-","buildings":"The Tours building remains the headquarters of the Departmental Archives and the place where most of the pre-1940 collections are kept and consulted.

The Chambray-lès-Tours building also has technical premises (bindery and photographic laboratory).\r\n\r\nSince 1 January 2014, a unique reading room welcomes the public in Tours: it is located at the Centre des Archives historiques, 6 rue des Ursulines in Tours.

Few changes were made until the directorate of Xavier du Boisrouvray (1953-1966), who emptied the depot and fitted it out with three levels and an attic with concrete floors supported by metal shelving with supporting posts.\r\n\r\nIn 1970, when the new prefecture was built, two rooms in the basement (about fifty metres from the main warehouse) allowed for a significant increase in shelving. However, the small size of the premises used by the public (the former salon of the Hôtel Migné, now a reading room) and the inconvenience of the offices (converted flats or attic) led to the search for a new location.\r\n\r\nSince October 2003, the departmental archives have been transferred to the former girls' teacher training school. This building, built in 1888-1889 by Henry Dauvergne, was restored and enlarged in 2000-2002 by the firm SAREA (Mr. Alain Sarfati) and Architectes et Associés de Châteauroux (Mr. Jean-Paul Broquet). It has a 48-seat reading room (some of which can be used to consult digitised collections), exhibition, conference and school rooms, and approximately 20 linear kilometres of shelving.","mandates":"The Indre Departmental Archives are a service of the Departmental Council.

From the parchment charter to the digital database, the competences of the Departmental Archives cover archives, a term whose broad definition encompasses paper documents as well as electronic and audiovisual documents, photographs or models, since it covers \"all documents, including data, whatever their date, place of storage, form and medium, produced or received by any natural or legal person and by any public or private service or organisation in the exercise of its activity\" (Heritage Code, art. L211-1).\r\n\r\nPublic archives include documents resulting from the activity of the State, local authorities, public establishments and other legal persons under public law; documents resulting from the management of a public service or the exercise of a public service mission by persons under private law; minutes and registers of public or ministerial officers and registers of notarised civil solidarity pact agreements Private archives are made up of all documents that do not fall into the category of public archives.","openingTimes":"Monday, Wednesday - Friday: 8:30 - 12:30 and 13:30 - 17:00\r\n\r\nclosed on Tuesday","conditions":"Access to the reading room: readers are required to leave their personal belongings in the cloakroom allocated to them and are only authorised to bring into the reading room the equipment necessary for taking notes (paper, pencil, laptop computer without bag, camera without bag).

The law of 5 Brumaire An V had ordered the gathering of all the titles and papers belonging to the Republic, that is to say those of the old and new administrations and those seized from the Church and the emigrants, at the county seat. This regrouping was done in Foix in the abbey Saint-Volusien, seat of the central administration then of the prefecture. Almost everything that had been gathered there disappeared one night in October 1803 in a fire that was certainly set to prevent conscription. The central collection of parish and civil registers was the first target, and with it the charters of the Château de Foix and the papers of the revolutionary administrations.\r\n\r\nFrom 1845 onwards, the Departmental Archives became a real service with an archivist-paleographer at its head from 1872. Expansion, reintegration of dispersed collections, creation of a library, and setting up a public reception area were the long and patient work of several generations. Special mention must be made of Félix Pasquier (1874-1895) who made this service a centre for conservation, research, publication and dissemination in all areas of Ariège civilisation, from medieval history to the works of the Félibrige movement, from archaeology to the organisation of the Foix festival...","mandates":"The Departmental Archives are responsible for the deposit of public archives by all administrations and public establishments whose headquarters are located in the department. They receive deposits from municipalities with fewer than 2000 inhabitants. They carry out an important action of collecting private archives which can enter by gift, legacy, deposit or purchase.\r\n\r\nClassification is a fundamental mission of the archive services. It consists of putting archive documents in intellectual and physical order. After classification, the documents are described and finding aids are written to enable readers to access the contents of the collections.\r\n\r\nArchive buildings are designed to ensure the physical preservation of documents in the best possible conditions in order to protect their integrity and allow their communication.

Communication is the result of the three previous missions and can take different forms\r\n-consultation in the reading room, where scientific researchers, genealogists, local history enthusiasts or citizens looking for a right can consult the documents\r\n-exhibitions, publications or conferences,\r\n-educational service for young people.\r\nCommunication also concerns the producing services which need to consult the files they have deposited.\r\n\r\nThe Departmental Archives have a training mission with regard to producing services, municipalities, public establishments. They assist them in managing current archives and in depositing definitive archives. This support may take the form of advice, training or on-site interventions.","buildings":"The Departmental Archives have always been confronted with the problem of the capacity of their premises. From the Prefecture, where they had been set up, they were transferred in 1943 to a disused building in the Foix prison, which they left in 1985 for the building which now houses them on the heights of Montgauzy.\r\n\r\n The building has filled up, which is normal, attendance has increased and the use of new technologies has developed. To meet these new needs, the General Council planned an extension to the building, which was completed in 2011. This extension increased the capacity of the shops and provided the public with a new, more spacious and user-friendly reading room.","openingTimes":"The reading room is open without appointment at the following times: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday from 8.30 a.m. to 12 noon and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., Wednesday from 8.30 a.m. to 12 noon.","conditions":"The Departmental Archives are a public service.

A barrack was built, not far from the teachers' training college. The documents were summarily stored there. In 1950, Jean Quéguiner became chief archivist of the Aisne. He was the first archivist to reside in Laon since 1941, which had an impact on the conservation of the collections. His constant concern was the dilapidated state of the temporary premises where the archives were stored. In his first report, he wrote: \"I would like to draw your attention to the urgent need to undertake the construction of a new repository, as the cramped and damp conditions of the current barracks are detrimental to the proper conservation of the department's archives. Shortly afterwards, he emphasised the resumption of normal activities of receiving deposits and filing, a resumption that was nevertheless difficult because of the dispersal of the buildings, but also because of their \"insalubrity, which compromises the good conservation of the archives, which are gradually rotting\". In 1950, the Aisne departmental archives only held 1,500 linear metres of documents. \r\n\r\nThe department was then transferred in 1954 to a new building, very modern for its time. It was equipped with 8,000 linear metres of shelving. This transfer and Jean Quéguiner's activity enabled the department to quickly resume its activities: numerous deposits and, consequently, processing work. In 1956, the Departmental Archives already held 6,100 linear metres of documents. It was during this period that documents from the prefecture and sub-prefectures of the Aisne began to arrive at the Departmental Archives. Very quickly, the new building was saturated.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was not until 1977 that the Archives moved to a new building in the lower town. It has a surface area of 6,000 m² and a total storage capacity of 21 linear kilometres.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the 2000s, the storage areas were rearranged and the regulatory eliminations did not leave enough space to accommodate future deposits. Therefore, an annex was put into service with a storage capacity of 3 linear kilometres. At the beginning of 2017, these two entities were on the verge of saturation. \r\n\r\nAlerted very early on, the Aisne Departmental Council decided to build a new storage facility in the Foch Park area. At the end of 2015, the work was entrusted to the Rabot-Dutilleul group. Construction began at the end of the first quarter of 2017 for delivery in June 2018.","buildings":"The new building offers a storage capacity of 40 linear kilometres, a modern reading room with 37 seats, an exhibition room of 150 m² and 5 training rooms including a conference room that can accommodate 80 to 120 people. In the long term, the building can be extended by 60 linear kilometres.","holdings":"The Aisne Departmental Archives make nearly 25 linear kilometres of documents available to the public; these illustrate the life of the Aisne department from the 9th century to the present day.

Sorting officers were charged with sorting out useful state documents, preserving historical archives and destroying all monarchical and feudal vestiges. They often confused the function of Paris, the capital of France, with that of chief town of the Seine department, by directing to the National Archives (created in 1790) documents that would naturally have belonged in the Archives of the Seine, created by the law of 5 Brumaire An V (26 October 1796).\r\n\r\nFrom 1803, the Archives de la Seine were housed in the Hôtel de Ville, then in 1860, in an annex on Avenue Victoria. The fires that ravaged Paris at the end of the Commune in May 1871 had disastrous consequences for the Parisian archives: in addition to parish records, civil status registers, documents resulting from the activities of Parisian guilds, religious communities, and parish factories, as well as the documents that existed in the courthouse, which was also burned down, were all reduced to ashes. From 1878 onwards, the archives of the Seine moved to Quai Henri IV. Following the law of 10 July 1964 on the reorganisation of the Paris region, the Seine department was abolished. There followed a new distribution (devolution) of the archives from the former prefecture of the Seine to the newly created Archives départementales de la petite couronne.\r\nIn order to be able to continue the statutory collection of the archives of the administrations located on the territory of Paris, several annexes to the one on the Quai Henri IV coexisted in the Paris region. A first annex was inaugurated in Villemoisson-sur-Orge in 1985 and the current Archives de Paris building, designed by the architects Henri and Bruno Gaudin, located at the Porte des Lilas, was inaugurated in 1990. A second annex in Seine-Saint-Denis, opened in 2018, further increases storage capacity.\r\n\r\nUntil 1975, the status of Paris was largely inspired by the law of 28 Pluviôse Year VIII (17 February 1800), which established a prefect for administration and a prefect for the police. It is only since 1975 that the prefect no longer has any municipal functions. Because of this dual status (city and department), the Archives of the Seine and then of Paris are both municipal and departmental archives, which can be considered the leading French territorial archive service: they conserve nearly 76 linear kilometres of documents, welcome more than 7,000 researchers in 15,000 working sessions and communicate approximately 45,000 documents each year.","mandates":"The missions of the Archives: to collect, classify, conserve and communicate\r\n\r\nFor more than 200 years, the Archives de Paris have been collecting, classifying, inventorying, conserving, communicating and promoting documents of historical interest concerning Paris or the former department of the Seine, whether they come from the services of the municipality, the department of Paris, the decentralised services of the State or private law organisations with a mission or a delegation of public service, established on the Parisian territory (prefectures, courts, the Paris council, schools, etc.).\r\n\r\n- Collecting: collecting public archives produced in the administrative area (the department of Paris), on the one hand, and private archives (archives of individuals, companies, associations or unions) of historical interest, on the other hand, by donation, deposit, purchase or bequest.\r\nThe Archives de Paris is a key contact for archiving.

Its initial mission: to protect, feed and support Jewish children who were victims of poverty and persecution.\r\n\r\nDuring the dark years of World War II in France, OSE turned into a Resistance organization. Its leaders, trainers and educators became rescuers, caretakers and heroes, hiding children under their responsibility behind false identities.\r\n\r\nOnce the War had ended, OSE faced the daunting task of accompanying to adulthood the children who had been orphaned and to take in others who had just been freed from concentration camps.\r\n\r\nYears later, with the end of the War in North Africa, came waves of migrants, children and families, who needed help integrating into France.\r\n\r\nIn 1951, OSE was recognized as a “Non-Profit Organization for the Public Good”. Today, it is open to people of all backgrounds and has diversified its missions to accommodate different needs and sectors of society.\r\n\r\nBased on its strong and unique experience in rescuing generations of uprooted children, OSE has developed more than ever before its commitment to children and to health issues.\r\n\r\nThe Organization also invests its efforts in the areas of handicap and dependency, as well as support to Holocaust survivors.\r\n\r\nRead more on OSE's history [here](http://www.ose-france.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Bochure-100-ans-OSE-anglais.pdf).","mandates":"The Archives and History Department's mission is to reconstruct the history of the OSE, an association created in 1912 in Saint Petersburg and established in France since the early 1930s. \r\n\r\nOne of the main missions of the service is to accompany people, mainly survivors and/or their families or relatives, in their research and procedures, particularly with a view to having their rights recognised. \r\n\r\nIn addition to its research and support role, the Archives and History Department uses a variety of media to pass on the history of the association during the war and in the post-war period: writing and publishing historical books and articles, designing exhibitions on different aspects of the OSE's history, taking part in conferences and colloquia, digitising children's files and archival documents, enriching the photographic database, assisting in the writing of testimonies and collecting testimonies of hidden children.","holdings":"Some 3,700 files of children from the Shoah who passed through the association's children's homes, as well as around 3,500 files of children who emigrated from the Maghreb countries and Egypt, are kept in the association's premises.

It was a memorable day. Several former internees belonging to different groups, Spanish republicans, French undesirables, Jews from the Baden region, met in Gurs in the greatest fraternity, in order to create the new Amicale. Pedro Marco, Valentino Battistuta, Oskar Althausen and Edmond Journaud met at the entrance to the camp on 29 April 1979. Their insides were stirred by emotion and joy, and they evoked the mud, the lice, the unbearable barbed wire and... the memory of their missing companions. They expressed their satisfaction at this reunion and the need for new meetings.\r\n\r\nAround them, in a fraternal atmosphere of a rare quality, other groups of \"elders\" exchanged identical impressions. In fact, the memory of Gurs is the result of the interlocking memories of groups corresponding to the \"families\" of internees who succeeded one another in the camp.\r\n\r\nThe new Amicale du camp de Gurs is now open to the Jews, who have been involved in the memory since the 1960s, to the Spaniards, who were already present in the first association, but also to the \"undesirables\" and to the third and most represented group, the \"French politicians\".\r\n\r\nAt its first congress, held at the Gurs town hall on Saturday 21 June 1980, the Amicale had to appoint a president. The first person to come to mind was General Luis Fernandez. Interned in 1914 in Bilbao in a family of railway workers, he participated in the defence of the Spanish Republic. After being in Gurs, he was enrolled in a labour company. He then participated in the organisation of the Spanish maquis. The guerrillas carried out many brilliant actions under the command of their \"general\" and liberated Toulouse. Approved as a colonel in the French Army, he received the rank of Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur in 1946 before going underground in 1950, because the Spanish Communist Party was banned in France. Continuing his activities, he was arrested in 1960 and deported to Poland. A serious accident allowed his return to France in 1963. His commitments made him a high-profile personality who, moreover, kept a very precise memory of what he had experienced, particularly in the Gurs camp. He would therefore be an ideal president for the Amicale, but he has a poor command of the French language. General Fernandez therefore proposed this function to several former internees present and it was finally Léon Bérody who accepted the post.\r\n\r\nRead more on the history of the Amicale du camp de Gurs [here](https://campgurs.com/lamicale/lhistoire-de-lamicale/le-temps-des-t%C3%A9moins-1975-1980/).","generalContext":"The Gurs Camp is located in Béarn, at nearly the centre of the department of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques. It was one of the biggest camps of France: it stretched 2km in length and was 500metres wide.\r\nThe camp was divised in 13 blocks that had each a letter of the alphabet as denomination (from A to M). Every block was subdivided in approximately 25 barracks. The barracks were made of wood and measured 30m long and 6m wide, if fully in use, they could host 60 persons. Nothing remains of the barracks today. \r\n\r\nThe Gurs Camp served as an administrative internment camp from 2 April 1939 to 31 December 1945. Four distinct groups were successively imprisoned in the camp. \r\n\r\n1- From 2 April 1939 to 10 May 1940: Spanish Republicans and volunteers of the International Brigades. In total 27 350 persons were imprisoned, all were men.\r\n\r\n2- From 10 May 1940 to 1 September 1940: \"undesirables\", essentially women from Germany or countries of the Third Reich. Some 100 men were also imprisoned with the women as political prisoners (communists, Spanish Basques, etc.). In total 14 795 men and women.\r\n\r\n3- From 1 September 1940 to 25 August 1944: foreign Jews were imprisoned in the camp.  In total 18 185 men, women and children were imprisoned due to the antisemitic laws of the Vichy Regime. From 1942,  will be systematically deported to Auschwitz and murdered. \r\n\r\n4- From 25 August to 31 December 1945: collaborationists and hundreds anti-Franco militants will be interned. In total 3 370 persons, exclusively men.\r\n\r\nThe Amicale du camp de Gurs, a non-profit association of volunteers, independent of any political party or pressure group, has been campaigning since 1980 :\r\n\r\n- to make the history of this French internment camp known to the public, so that the memory of the men, women and children who were imprisoned there, starting with the Spanish republicans and the Jews, is not lost and that they are honoured.\r\n- for a reflection among the general public and schoolchildren on the causes and realities of the internment at Gurs.\r\n- for the defence of Freedom and the respect of Human Rights, today, in the whole world.","holdings":" - All archives relating to the period before 28 June 1940 have been destroyed.

In 1937 the library settles in rue La Bruyère, but in the spring of 1940, shortly after the fall of Paris, the Nazis looted the premises, shipping much of the material to Frankfurt am Main. The years after the liberation witnessed a patient work of reconstruction funds and catalogs. The revival of Jewish studies in France and the growing success of the library lead to the expansion of the premises, which was realized in 1989.","holdings":"The AIU library houses not only Europe's largest collection of books in Jewish studies, but also many archival materials from the AIU and, more broadly, the entire Jewish world. Since its inception in 1860, the IAU has kept much of the correspondence between the Central Committee and the teaching staff in its schools around the Mediterranean, in the East and in the Balkans. During the Second World War, these archives were looted by the Nazi occupier. The part of the archives which were found back in 1945 form the Historical Archives (1860-1940) were classified in 1960 and are available for consultation.

They were mainly tradesmen, coming from Gibraltar and Morocco (Tangier, Tetouan and Mogador) and some of their names still expressed a connection to their Iberic lands of origin, before the period they were expelled from there. That is the case of CONQUI (from Cuenca, province of Cuenca) or CARDOSO (from Cardoso, Viseu District).\r\n\r\nThey were above average-learned people, knowing how to read and write and speaking, besides the liturgical Hebrew, the Arabic or English and Haquitia, a Jewish-Hispanic-Moroccan dialect. They had numerous international contacts, not only due to their trading activities but also to their family ties spread around the world. These factors explain the quick economic and cultural flourishing not only of Lisbon Jews but also of the groups that have been settling on the first half of the XIX Century in the Azores and in Faro.\r\n\r\nParallel to their fast and successful integration in the Portuguese way of life, the first Jewish groups have sought to organize themselves as such, creating prayer lounges and acquiring plots to bury their dead loved ones according to the Jewish Ritual. The first grave belongs to José Amzalak, departed in February 26th 1804 and buried in a plot belonging to the English Cemetery of Estrela, definitely due to the British nationality of the first Jews in Lisbon, that came, as we have seen, from Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nBy this time, Jews were still considered as a foreign colony and the community had no legal existence yet. The Constitutional Charter of 1826 only recognized Catholicism as the sole religion allowed to Portuguese citizens, referring all the other creeds to foreigners. That is why back then it was called the Israeli “colony”, just like the English or German colonies were.\r\n\r\nSince legalization of the community was not possible to get, Jews in Lisbon, especially in the second half of the XIX Century, decided to create charity institutions in the form of autonomous associations, which statutes were submitted for approval to the Civil Government or in the form of private foundations, usually managed by Ladies. These institutions have played a key role in the unity and organization of Portuguese Judaism. We will mention only three:\r\n\r\nSomej-Nophlim (Protection to the Poor): created in 1865 by Simão Anahory with the aim to help the poor. Later, in 1916, this association opens the Israeli Hospital that played an important role in supporting Israeli refugees during the Second World War.\r\n\r\nGuemilut Hassadim: founded in 1892 by Moses Anahory to minister spiritual aid and deal with the Jewish burials.\r\n\r\nEconomic Kitchen: founded in 1899, it played, like the Israeli Hospital, an important role during the World War II.\r\n\r\nAnother decisive step to the formation of the present Jewish Community of Lisbon is taken in 1894 with the achievement of a General Assembly of Jews in Lisbon with the aim of unify the Shehitá services (ritual slaughter and provision of kosher meat). Under the push of Isaac Levy and Simão Anahory, in 1897, a process that leads to the creation of an organizing committee to build a unique synagogue and the election of the I Committee of the Israeli Community in Lisbon begins, having Abraham Bensaúde as its Honorary President and Simão Anahory as the Effective President.\r\n\r\nSince 1810 there were several prayer houses in Lisbon, but they hardly had the required conditions to the worship service, since they were located on humble apartments. Nevertheless, despite the difficulties caused by the lack of official recognition, the community manages to buy, under the name of private individuals, a ground for the construction of a new building, proper and decent.\r\n\r\nThe authorship of the synagogue’s project belonged to one of the greatest architects of that time, Miguel Ventura Terra. Located at nr 59 of Rua Alexandre Herculano, it had to be built inside a walled yard, since it was not allowed to build the façade facing the public street as it was not a Catholic temple, faith which was the official State religion at the time.\r\n\r\nThe First Stone being layed in 1902, the Shaaré-Tikva Synagogue is finally inaugurated in 1904, ending a more than 50 years’ effort from the Jews in Lisbon.\r\n\r\nThe first step to the official recognition of Israeli Community of Lisbon dates from 1868, when the Government grants a Permit, through a Charter from King D. Luís that gives “Jews from Lisbon the permission to establish a cemetery to bury their co-religionists”. This is the old Calçada das Lages Cemetery, presently known as Afonso III Cemetery, which is still an active cemetery to this day.\r\n\r\nThis Royal diploma has a true historical importance, since it is an implicit, though non-formal, acknowledgement of the Israeli Community of Lisbon. Actually, this one will only be officially recognized by the Republican Government in 1912, precisely 416 years after the Edict of Expulsion and almost a century after the Inquisition’s extinction.\r\n\r\nThe official recognition of the community and construction of the synagogue gave a new boost to the community’s life in Lisbon. Thus, soon in 1912 the Hebrew Studies Association “Ubá le Zion” is created, whose great promoter was Adolfo Benarus, professor of the Faculty of Letters of Lisbon, writer and educator, founder of the Israeli School too, in 1929, school that once had nearly 100 students.\r\n\r\nThe creation of a bulletin, directed by Joseph Benoliel, a bond between the members of the community, the organization of a Library in 1915 and the foundation of the Hehaver Israeli Youth Association in 1925 were other mark stones of the Israeli Community of Lisbon’s consolidation.\r\n\r\nYet, from that time on, the community will experience, as a result of the European events, a deep change both in terms of its action and of its composition. The anti-Semitic persecutions in the east and the fast rise of Nazism in Germany lead to the arrival into Portugal of the first Ashkenazi Jews that quickly adapt to the Portuguese society and the Israeli Community. The outbreak of World War II, the neutrality policy to which Portugal referred to in the framework of the alliance with England and the granting of transit visas to nearly one hundred thousand refugees originated an influx of tens of thousands of Jews to Portugal. The few who stayed changed the mostly Sephardic proportions of the Lisbon community.\r\n\r\nPortuguese Jews played an important role during this period in supporting these refugees, first through the creation of the “Portuguese Commission for Assistance to the Refugee-Jews in Portugal” (COMASSIS) directed by Augusto Esaguy, and later straightly led through the Community's own refugee-support section, chaired by Moisés Amzalak and whose great animator was Elias Baruel.

Since it was installed in one of the towers of Lisbon castle, probably during the reign of King Dom Fernando, and certainly from 1378, date of the first known certificate, until 1755, it served as the Archives of the king, his vassals, the administration of the kingdom and the overseas possessions, as well as keeping the documents resulting from the relations with other kingdoms.\r\n\r\nBesides serving the royal administration, with functions similar to those of a modern-day intermediate archive, the most important service provided by the Tower was that of certificates, requested by individuals and institutions. With the king's authorisation, it provided consultation and even the loan of documents to some scholars, whose works were later printed.\r\nIn the 17th century, the Archive of the Archives started to be organised and the first record books appeared, and some indexes were made. In the 18th century, the growing number of certificates requested to the Torre do Tombo, especially those requested by the History Academy, increased the number of its officers. In this century, in the scope of the description of the documents, numerous indexes were produced, meeting the need to know the documents and to create the necessary research tools for their recovery: this work started and took place, in good part, in the building of the castle tower: This is how most of the indexes of the royal Chancelleries (1715-1749), the Laws and Ordinances (1731), the Bulls (1732), the Residents of the Royal Household (between 1713 and 1742), the inventory of the Bulae, Breves and Pontifical Transcripts (1751-1753) were drawn up.\r\n\r\nOn November 1st 1755, the tower collapsed during the earthquake. The documentation was collected from the rubble, and temporarily kept in a wooden hut, built in the Praça de Armas, after authorization from the Marquis of Pombal, dated November 6. On 26 and 27 August 1757, it was transferred to a part of the building of the São Bento da Saúde Monastery, on the Calçada da Estrela side, occupying the facilities called Casa dos Bispos and contiguous compartments, which were leased to the monastery. It was then necessary to proceed with its installation, and its organization: the bundles from the Casa da Coroa, were organized in a Chronological Body collection, and in a Fragments collection. The officials of the archive made several copies of documents, namely the Reform of Drawers, the Reform of Old Forals, and the Collection of Copies. They continued the work of description of documents, which resulted in the indexes of the Chronological Body (1764), the summaries and indexes of the documents of the Drawers (1765), the indexes of the books of the Menus (1765), the indexes of the bundles of the Royal House Houses and Officials (1767, 1770), and the inventory of the documents of the Crown's House (1776). Some of these instruments of description can still be consulted today at the Reference Service.\r\n\r\nFrom 1777 onwards, by the Regiment of August 1st, the registry books of the end of the reigns were obliged to be sent to the Torre do Tombo. In 1791, by Notice dated February 5th, the General Registry of Mercês was transferred to the Torre do Tombo, and continued to operate in this institution until 1927.\r\n\r\nIn the early 19th century, the duties of the Archives were extended to the training of civil servants, and to the teaching of Diplomatics, with the creation of the Diplomatics Classroom.\r\n\r\nUntil 1823, the Archives were subject to the Council of the Treasury, although they also depended on other institutions during the period of the Ancien Regime. From then until 1887, it depended on the General Directorate of Public Instruction of the Ministry of the Kingdom.\r\n\r\nDuring the liberal period, the Torre do Tombo, designated as the National Archives in the 1823 Regulations, or as the Royal Archives of the Torre do Tombo, was called upon to perform much wider-ranging duties, initiating a new phase in institutional life, marked by the incorporation of documents from the archives of the abolished courts of the Ancien Regime, in 1821 and 1833, and from the registry offices of the religious corporations, abolished by Decree on May 28th, 1834. There were four major cycles of incorporations throughout the 19th century, from various institutions, which contributed to the disorganization of the collections, which were not complete.\r\n\r\nIn this environment of growing documentation in the Archives, the Provisional Regulations of 30th April 1823 called for the creation of different types of indexes, and recommended the preservation of the order of the documents.\r\n\r\nThe new Regulations published in 1839 charged the Archives with the duty of incorporating documents deemed unnecessary to the institutions themselves and those of extinct bodies, ensuring their proper preservation and installation.\r\n\r\nThe Law of 2 October 1862 established that all consignments of documents must be accompanied by the respective inventories, drawn up according to their provenance.\r\n\r\nIn the 19th century, the Archives suffered from a shortage of staff, who were divided among the Secretariat of the Mercês Registry, and from poor facilities. These were only improved in 1861, when the Torre do Tombo Archives moved to the right wing of the monastery, on the Rua de São Bento side.\r\n\r\nAlthough it invested in document description, the conception of an archive as a public service for the disclosure of document contents was a late arrival: the public consultation of the Torre do Tombo documents began timidly, in 1901, by Decree of December 24th, being foreseen for the scholars to whom the conservators had to give support.\r\n\r\nThe Decree of 18th March 1911 reorganized the library and archive services under the Directorate-General for Secondary, Higher and Special Education, definitively designated the National Archives of the Torre do Tombo as the National Archives, emphasized its role in the conservation and promotion of manuscripts intended for the study of History, as well as in promoting the entry of copies of Portuguese manuscripts from abroad, and established, for the first time, public opening hours.\r\n\r\nOver the last hundred years, the National Archive has grown significantly with the integration of several archival services: the Archives of the Completed Trials (in 1915, by Decree no. 1659, of 15th June), and the Archives of the National Archives of Portugal (in 1916, by Decree no. 1659, of 15th June). In the last hundred years, the National Archive has grown significantly, with the integration of various archive services: the Archives of Findings (in 1915, by Decree no. 1659, of 15th June), the Archive of Parochial Records, accumulating the functions of Lisbon District Archive (from 1918 to 1992), the Archive of Congregations (in 1930), the Historical Archive of the Ministry of Finance (in 1992) and more recently the Lisbon service of the Portuguese Photography Centre (2007).\r\n\r\nIn 1931, by Decree no. 19,592, of 31st June, the National Archive was designated as the General Archive, and became technically and administratively subject to the Inspection of Erudite Libraries and Archives, which in 1965 became the responsibility of the General Directorate for Higher Education and Fine Arts of the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\nSince 1985, the National Archive has depended on the Ministry of Culture with administrative autonomy. In 1927, 1931, 1933 and 1965, the remaining district archives were created, to which the Inspectorate sent the documents still existing in the Treasury's departments.\r\n\r\nThus, in 1988, the Portuguese Archives Institute was created by Decree-Law no. 152/88, of 29th April, and remained in operation until 1992, when it merged with the National Archives of the Torre do Tombo, by Decree-Law no. 106-G/92, of 1st June, taking the name of National Archives/Torre do Tombo (AN/TT).\r\n\r\nAfter 1990, when the National Archives were moved to the purpose-built building in Alameda da Universidade, with larger premises, new additions occurred, namely, in 1992, with the addition of the documentation of the Secretaries of State, mentioned in Article 25 of the Law of March 1911, followed by many other acquisitions.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the national archival policy, extended to the production of documents and the management of current archives, to document evaluation and selection and to intermediate archives, was reflected in the change of name of the National Archives, renamed Instituto dos Arquivos Nacionais/Torre do Tombo (IAN/TT). From 1997, in accordance with the organic law published in Decree-Law no. 60/97, of 20th March, it has been responsible for promoting and implementing national archival policy, in terms of preserving and enhancing national archival heritage, promoting the quality of current archives, and safeguarding and guaranteeing the rights of the State and citizens.\r\n\r\nIts own identity was recovered in 2007 by the organic law, and it was re-designated Arquivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo, becoming a national scope archive dependent on the Directorate-General of Archives.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, under the Central Administration Reduction and Improvement Plan (PREMAC) in line with the organic law of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, established by Decree-Law No. 126 -A/2011, of 29 December and in accordance with Decree-Law No. 103/2012 of 16 May 2012. 103/2012 of 16th May, which establishes the organic structure of the Directorate-General of Books, Archives and Libraries, (which results from the merger of the Directorate-General of Books and Libraries with the Directorate-General of Archives), the National Archives of the Torre do Tombo is now an integral service of this Directorate-General. By the same diploma, the Lisbon District Archive is reintegrated into the Torre do Tombo.\r\n\r\nSince then, the National Archives of Torre do Tombo is a central organic unit, as a service dependent on the Directorate General of Books, Archives and Libraries , as per Ordinance no. 192/2012, of 19 June, and its competences were fixed by Order no. 9339/2012, of 27 June.","mandates":"Read [here](https://antt.dglab.gov.pt/inicio/identificacao-institucional/missao-e-objectivos/).","administrativeStructure":"The National Archives of Torre do Tombo is a service dependent on the General Directorate of Books, Archives and Libraries, central service of direct management of the state - integrated into the Ministry of Culture - and is one of the national archives of the Portuguese archives network.","holdings":"USHMM has surveyed and copied in this archive.

In 1988, and for many years, the documentation was stored in a small warehouse of the General Secretariat. This body was responsible for managing all the documentation of the PLC.

During the extraordinary session held in 1926 to discuss Germany's admission to the League, the Assembly approved an international architectural competition for the construction of the Palais des Nations, the future home of the League of Nations.\r\n\r\nIn 1927, 377 architectural projects were submitted to the League of Nations. As it was impossible to reach a unanimous agreement on a single submission, five architects were appointed to work on a common project: Julien Flegenheimer of Switzerland, Camille Lefèvre and Henri-Paul Nénot of France, Carlo Broggi of Italy and József Vágó of Hungary. Though not included in the original design, a library was incorporated into the architectural project, thanks to a US $2 million donation from John D. Rockefeller Jr.\r\n\r\nWith the inclusion of a library, the League of Nations needed to find a larger parcel of land than originally planned along the shores of Lake Geneva. Ultimately, through an exchange with the City of Geneva, the Palais found its home in the 46-hectare Ariana Park. The Park had been bequeathed to the City of Geneva by Gustave Revilliod upon his death in 1890, as the last descendent of the Revilliod de la Rive family.  \r\n\r\nBuilt in the art deco style of the times, the foundation stone of the Palais was ceremoniously laid in Ariana Park on 7 September 1929.

The 19th century saw the first attempts at centralisation in the municipal archives system. In view of the incorporation of Zurich in 1893 (takeover of 11 municipal archives), the creation of an archive plan became urgent. This resulted in the division of the archival material into ten sections, designated with Roman numerals (1894). At that time, the city archive was headed by the substitute of the city clerk; organisationally, it belonged to the city chancellery. Although the Municipal Code of the City of Zurich, in force since 1893, had already envisaged a City Archivist as head of the municipal archives \"for the archival business\" (Municipal Code of 24 July 1892, Art. 63), this position was not created until 1930. From 1909 onwards, the Zurich City Archives had a permanent archivist for the first time, which meant that it could be continuously looked after. At the same time, the City Archives opened up to the public. The municipal ordinance of 15 January 1933 finally separated the City Archives from the City Chancellery. With the second incorporation, another 8 municipal archives were added to the Zurich City Archives in 1934.","mandates":"https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/prd/de/index/stadtarchiv/ueber_uns/rechtsgrundlagen.html","administrativeStructure":"The City Archive is a service department of the Presidential Department of the City of Zurich.

The organization’s founding fathers were Nikolai Bakst, Baron Horace Gunzburg and Samuel Poliakov.\r\nTogether with several influential members of the St Petersburg Jewish community they obtained permission to form ORT, a “charitable fund for a useful purpose”, in honor of the Tsar’s 25th anniversary. The name “ORT” was coined from the acronym of the Russian words “Obshestvo Remeslennogo i zemledelcheskogo Truda”, meaning “The Society for Trades and Agricultural Labour”.\r\nORT distributed funds to Jewish schools for handicraft and agricultural training and provided grants or loans to artisans and farmers. In the early 1900s the organization began to sponsor cooperative ventures, to support training programs in Jewish schools and to establish its own vocational schools.\r\nDuring and after the First World War, ORT’s workshops, credit and labour offices saved thousands from starvation and unemployment. In 1921 the ORT Union (today’s World ORT) was created to coordinate fundraising efforts and to oversee ORT’s growing activities in Europe and elsewhere.\r\nThrough the interwar years ORT supported Jewish farmers with equipment, loans and training while graduates of ORT’s technical schools gained employment as technicians and engineers. In the 1930s ORT courses helped Jewish refugees fleeing the rise of Hitler to prepare for life in other countries.\r\nIn the Soviet Union, ORT worked with the authorities to establish industries and supply materials and machinery but was forced to close down its operations in 1938.\r\n\r\nThe movement of Jewish refugees led to the development of new ORT programs beyond Europe, mainly in South America. In Europe, during the Holocaust, ORT became a “Passport to Life” as our trainees in ghettos received extra food rations and were selected for labour details. In many cases, this meant the difference between life and death.\r\n\r\nAfter the war ORT trained tens of thousands of survivors and displaced persons from Jewish communities throughout Europe. ORT graduates contributed to the building of the early Jewish community of Palestine and, after the founding of the State of Israel, ORT became a key feature in the country’s education system.\r\nORT also turned its attention to the needs of “forgotten” Jewish communities in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Iran.\r\nIn 1960 ORT was asked by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to undertake technical training programs in Africa. Seeing this as an integral part of its mission, ORT took up the challenge and began a new phase of humanitarian activities outside the international Jewish community while at the same time expanding its work with Jewish communities in France, Latin America, North Africa, the Middle East and India.\r\nIn Ethiopia, ORT received permission to operate in the Gondar province in 1977. It brought crafts, vocational skills, modern agricultural methods, medical help and general and Jewish education to these remote areas.\r\nIn the 1990s ORT returned to Russia, the country of its birth, followed by other countries in the former Soviet Union (FSU) and Eastern Europe.\r\nIn addition to its existing Jewish day schools in Latin America and elsewhere, ORT established day schools in the major Jewish communities in the FSU as well as vocational training centers for women in rural FSU communities.\r\nIn 2007 ORT founded the World ORT Kadima Mada educational network in Israel. Today, ORT is active worldwide and provides skills training and self-help projects.\r\n\r\nRead more on ORT's history [here](https://ortarchive.ort.org/establishment/founders-of-ort).","mandates":"The World ORT Archive (WOA) exists to preserve the historical record of World ORT’s activities and to place these activities into the context of contemporary Jewish History.","holdings":"ORT’s work has been carried out against the backdrop of contemporary Jewish History. Its governance, fundraising activities and operations have left a paper trail of documents and photographs that tells the story of a prominent Jewish organisation participating in the major historical events of the period. The archives include documents, reports, correspondence, films, videos and photographs that provide a valuable insight into all the organisation’s past activities.\r\n\r\n[WOA’s document collection](https://ortarchive.ort.org/media/documents) includes records of World ORT (formerly World ORT Union), its governing bodies and associate organisations world-wide. It includes minutes of meetings, reports, correspondence, fund-raising and PR, research and development, administrative and financial records. These provide a valuable insight into the organisation’s activities and the communities which it served. The majority of records are World ORT’s own organisational files and regrettably, with few exceptions, there are no personal records of former ORT students.\r\n\r\n[WOA’s photographic collection](https://ortarchive.ort.org/media-resources/photos) is a unique archival collection: it documents the organisation’s involvement in Jewish working life, education and vocational training across the globe from the 1920s through to the present day. Its holdings illustrate the hardships and triumphs of the Jewish people throughout modern history. In many cases these photographs are the only remaining record of past communities, places and events.\r\n\r\n[WOA’s film collection](https://ortarchive.ort.org/media/video) is a unique record of the organisation’s contribution to the development and advancement of Jewish education and vocational training in the 20th century. The films document ORT activities among Jewish communities worldwide. Many feature communities that have since dispersed and disappeared, specifically those of North Africa and Iran. They are a testament to the individual character and history of these communities and focus on a particular aspect of their lives, often neglected in other documentaries – education and learning.","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[51.5877713,-0.21986907]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"gb","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/gb-006585","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/gb-006585/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/gb"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2023-01-27T09:56:32.900Z"}},{"id":"de-002623","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Stadtarchiv München","parallelFormsOfName":["Munich City Archive"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Winzererstr. 68","city":"München","region":"Bayern","postalCode":"80797","country":"Germany","countryCode":"DE","email":["stadtarchiv@muenchen.de"],"telephone":["+49 (0)89 233 0308"],"fax":["+49 (0)89 233 30830"],"url":["https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/Stadtverwaltung/Direktorium/Stadtarchiv.html"]},"openingTimes":"Monday, Tuesday & Thursday: 09:00am to 06:00pm\r\nWednesday: 09:00am to 12:00 am","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[48.160503,11.562014]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"de","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de-002623","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de-002623/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de"},"meta":{"subitems":5,"updated":"2023-01-23T17:00:10.106Z"}},{"id":"ch-005503","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Stadtarchiv der Ortsbürgergemeinde St. Gallen","parallelFormsOfName":["City Archive Sankt Gallen"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Notkerstrasse 22","city":"Sankt Gallen","region":"Saint Gallen","postalCode":"9000","country":"Switzerland","countryCode":"CH","email":["stefan.sonderegger@ortsbuerger.ch","stadtarchiv@ortsbuerger.ch"],"telephone":["+41 (71) 244 08 17","+41 (71) 244 07 05 "],"fax":[],"url":["https://stadtarchiv.ch/"]},"holdings":"The city archive of the Ortsbürgergemeinde preserves the historical estate of the city of St Gallen from the 13th to the 19th century, as well as the current archives of the local civil administration.

The tasks of the State Archives are derived from this requirement. They are regulated in detail in the Archive Ordinance.\r\n\r\nAs the \"memory of the canton of Schaffhausen\", the Schaffhausen State Archives are responsible for archiving documents of the cantonal offices and dependent institutions of the canton. It also takes over documents from the cantonal courts. As a historical archive, it also safeguards the records of the city-state of Schaffhausen up to 1830.","records":"Of the documents that are created each year in the administration, not all can be permanently preserved simply because of their mass. The State Archives therefore examine documents from the administration and the judiciary for their lasting value for future generations, both from a legal and a historical point of view. A representative cross-section is formed from the documents on offer, which sometimes comprises only 1-2% of the documents on offer. Since the history of the canton is not only reflected in administrative records, the State Archives also takes over records from associations or private individuals.\r\n\r\nThe transfer to the State Archives turns the written material into \"archival material\", which is indexed in an archival database. This is the basis for using the archival records, which can also be researched online.  The specialist staff advise users on their research and make the archive records available for consultation in the reading room. The State Archives also take various conservation measures for the long-term preservation of the archive material.","buildings":"The Schaffhausen State Archives are presumably the only Swiss state archives still housed in a 17th century archival building. Those who work and research here can thus do so using today's technical possibilities in an archive building that has preserved a piece of cultural and administrative history in its architecture in a special way.\r\n\r\nThe history of the archive building dates back to 1610, when a treasure vault was established at the current location of Rathausbogen 4. In 1669, under the direction of city architect Heinrich Peyer, an archive room was built, which today is open to the public as a reading room for anyone interested. The iron door richly decorated with painted ornamentation and the Renaissance sandstone supraport with the painted coats of arms of the estates, mayors and councillors are considered special features of art history. The stucco ceiling is presumably by the well-known Schaffhausen stucco artist Samuel Höscheller.\r\n\r\nDue to the steadily growing mass of written material, the archive building was extended several times in the past centuries. In 1732, the so-called \"Censurube\" of the neighbouring building was added to the archive and used for decades as the archivist's office. In 1885, the building was partially demolished, rebuilt and enlarged under the direction of cantonal architect Johann Christian Bahnmeier. In 1936, the building was raised by one floor.\r\n\r\nToday, the archive building houses the reading room, offices and part of the stacks. ","holdings":"The spectrum of historical records ranges from around 6,000 documents to official books and files to a growing number of digital, digitised and hybrid documents.

However, these protection periods do not necessarily have to be an exclusion criterion for scientific research projects or in the case of personal involvement, as there is the possibility of a reduction of the protection period by those departments which have handed over the files to the State Archives.

Initially, the focus of its archival activity was on legal documents from the early years of the Swiss Confederation and the subsequent transitional period from 1798 to the foundation of the canton. The change in legal structure during this time led to the transfer of archival records to other cantons. Archival records, such as those from the bailiwicks of Rheintal or Sax, were finally able to be incorporated into the St. Gallen State Archive. However, some of the proposed acquisitions were difficult and some failed.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the State Archive was able to acquire other valuable archives belonging to public bodies from the period before the canton was founded, such as the Rheineck Town Archive and the Lichtensteig Town Archive.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the canton consisted of twelve independent ‘states’ prior to 1798 is reflected in the archival landscape. For example, not all the written records from these regions are held in the State Archive. Important archival records from the period before the founding of the canton can be found in the Abbey Archive and in the St. Gallen Local Authority City Archive (the archive of the former imperial city and republic of St. Gallen), in various other cantonal archives and in communal archives in the canton. There is currently no overview of all the archival records relating to St. Gallen in other Swiss archives from before 1798. However, the cantonal records since 1803 have been secured, although there are gaps in certain periods. Important privately-owned records have been acquired in recent years and the State Archive has developed a consistent process for overseeing and evaluating records, which has been in place since 2003. In addition, the State Archive plays a significant role in digital preservation. In this and other areas, it collaborates with other archives both nationally and internationally (e.g. archives in the Arge Alp).","generalContext":"The State Archives of the Canton of St.Gallen is the memory of the canton. As a modern information centre, it advises authorities and departments on the creation and management of their dossiers and ensures their permanent preservation.\r\nDocuments of private institutions, organisations, families and individuals that are important for the history of the canton and its population are also permanently included in these archives. In this way, all indexed documents can be made accessible to government agencies, academia and private individuals.\r\nAs a centre of competence for history and archives, archives are evaluated in publications, through exhibitions and at conferences to support and stimulate research.","mandates":"The Gesetz über Aktenführung und Archivierung (Act on Filing and Archiving – SGS 147.1) of 19 April 2011 defines the State Archive as the highest specialised cantonal body for filing and archiving. It decides on the archival value of documents offered and guarantees permanent storage and access to the records. The archive ensures the traceability of the actions of public bodies and contributes to the provision of ongoing legal certainty. In addition, it ensures the preservation of records relating to private institutions, organisations, families and individuals, in as far as these are relevant to the history of the canton and its population, and have been provided to it. It takes an independent role in carrying out its responsibilities. Further details of its legal basis and responsibilities can be found in the Verordnung über Aktenführung und Archivierung (Ordinance on Records Management and Archiving – SGS 147.11) of 19 March 2019.","administrativeStructure":"Organisationally, the State Archive is part of the Department of the Interior, located in the Office of Culture.","buildings":"Originally built by Felix Wilhelm Kubly from 1838 to 1841 as an armoury, the north wing of the government building was in poor condition in the early 1970s. The Cantonal Council commissioned St. Gallen architect Ernest Brantschen (1922–1994) with a reconstruction project in 1970. The building was to serve as an archival and administrative complex in the future. Extensive renovations and the addition of new parts to the building were required for this. Since 1979, the State Archive, Abbey Archive and Cantonal Court have been based in this north wing, which is part of the Abbey District. Due to the increasing numbers of records and the inability to extend the building, two other buildings now house an external storage facility and other offices and workshops.","holdings":"The records are divided into state and non-state archival records. They are further divided into the following sections:\r\n\r\nState archival records\r\n\r\n- Old Archive (until 1798) (AA): Documents, files and books from the bailiwicks of Rheintal, Sax-Forstegg, Werdenberg, Sargans, Gaster, Uznach and the city of Rapperswil. Individual files and books on the history of Toggenburg and the historical territory of Fürstenland.\r\n- Helvetic Archive (1798-1803) (HA): Files and books from the canton of Säntis and the St. Gallen parts of the canton of Linth.\r\n- Archive of the Cantonal Parliament and Government (AGR, ARR): Minutes and files on parliamentary and governmental decisions.\r\n- Cantonal Archive (1803–1931) (KA): Files, books and official publications of the cantonal administration, archived based on a classification system using the pertinence principle.\r\n- New Archive (from 1931) (A): Records from the cantonal administration, archived in the order in which they were received and by place of delivery using the provenance principle.\r\n- Court Archive (from 1803) (G, GA): Rulings and acts from the regional and cantonal courts.\r\n- St. Gallen official publications (from 1803) (ZA): Publications from state authorities.\r\n- Independent institutions of the state and companies with significant public involvement (B, HSG): Archives from the Building Insurance Institute, the Bodensee-Toggenburg-Bahn, the St. Gallen-Appenzell power plants and the University of St. Gallen.\r\n\r\nNon-state archival records\r\n\r\n- Corporation Archive (C): Archival records from public or private corporations.\r\n- Private Archive (W): Estate and archival records of parties, organisations, companies, families and individuals.\r\n- Archival collections from the State Archive (KP, Z, BM): Items including photographs, maps, plans, coins and medals.\r\n\r\nIn terms of materials, the records are primarily on paper, but may also be parchment, celluloid or glass plates. Questions about the long-term durability of electronic data and media are becoming increasingly important.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, the State Archive records would cover more than 10 kilometres. Every year, the archive grows by another 100 to 200 metres.","openingTimes":"Tuesday to Friday: 8.15-12.00, 14.00 -17.15","conditions":"Only registered persons will be served, so a pre-registration and document order at least three working days in advance is required.","researchServices":"The Online Archive Catalogue offers numerous search options.
