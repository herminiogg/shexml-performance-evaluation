Gestapo, SS and Reich Security Main Office on the ‘Prinz-Albrecht-Terrain’” was presented in a newly created exhibition hall designed by the Berlin architect Jürg Steiner. At the same time the terrain, with its excavated remains of several buildings, was equipped with information panels commenting on the site’s history. The exhibition – designed as part of the central historical exhibition “Berlin, Berlin” in the Martin-Gropius-Bau – was originally intended to be shown only for the duration of the anniversary year. But as a result of its immense success, at the end of 1987 the decision was made to extend the temporary exhibition until the end of the following year and finally, for an indefinite period.\r\nIn February 1989 the Berlin Senate appointed a commission of experts under the chairmanship of Professor Reinhard Rürup, scholarly director of the “Topography of Terror,” to develop a concept for the long-range design and use of the grounds of the “Topography of Terror.” In its final report of March 1990, the commission emphasized the national and international significance of the historic site and recommended the establishment of a documentation and visitor center. The historic site was to remain mainly as it was with the exposed building remains and traces of the postwar period. These recommendations were accepted as the basis for future political decisions by the Berlin House of Representatives and Senate, and shortly thereafter by the German federal government as well. They were also discussed during two several day-long hearings with the Berlin public and international experts.\r\nIn 1992 the “Topography of Terror,” a citizen-supported project of the Berliner Festspiele, was first established as a dependent foundation under public law. That same year the state of Berlin invited twelve participants to submit designs to an architectural competition for the new documentation center. In 1993, the winner of the first prize, the Swiss architect Peter Zumthor (Haldenstein), was commissioned to realize his design.\r\nIn May 2004 the state of Berlin and the German federal government, as joint sponsors of the Topography of Terror Foundation, decided not to complete the building project because of exploding costs and technical building problems. The construction, begun in 1997, had been halted in 1999.\r\nThe third competition for the site of the “Topography of Terror” was preceded by a period of intense preparation. A public symposium and two specialist colloquia were conducted on the “Historic Site and Historical Documentation: Building for the Topography of Terror.” A concrete program was developed for the architectural competition under the guidance of the foundation’s executive director Professor Andreas Nachama. The recommendations of the expert commission of 1990 remained the basis for the updated concept.\r\n(Source: http://www.topographie.de/en/the-historic-site/)","holdings":"The library currently holds ca. 30,000 volumes, ca. 130 current periodicals and 100 completed periodicals.\r\nThe collection focuses on subjects generally related to the SS, Gestapo and police during National Socialism.

Its central task consists of acquiring and recording archives of major importance for the arts and the history of art, and of making them available to academic researchers and those of the general public who are interested. In exhibitions, lectures, readings, concerts and publications, too, the Archive publicises its holdings and makes them available for external exhibitions. It is also in charge of the museum sections of the Brecht-Weigel and Anna Seghers Memorial Centres. \r\n\r\nLike the members of the Academy itself, the Archive covers all the arts. Thus, along with individual genres, the focus falls on art and culture in their reciprocal relation and on the dialogue between the arts. Thus it is possible to research the collaboration which takes place between authors, performing artists, composers or creative artists in the theatre, or the connection between authors and composers in the creation of opera or song. The institutional division of the arts into media, visual and performing arts thus becomes redundant – as redundant as the division between film and theatre archives in the case of directors and actors. This approach reflects the way the arts have mutually interpenetrated each other in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The overarching focal points in the Archive’s collections indicate the general framework which has influenced the arts in their totality: exile during National Socialism; artists and cultural life in Germany, and particularly in Berlin, since 1900; the situation in the GDR; but also the history of the Academy as an institution, standing as a whole for the exchange of experience between the arts and their public representation.\r\n(Source: http://www.adk.de/en/archive/the-academy-archive/index.htm)","openingTimes":"Monday to Friday: 09:00am to 05:00pm\r\nThursday: 09:00am to 07:00pm ","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[52.51581,13.37955]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"de","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de-002423","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de-002423/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2018-07-09T11:19:48.513Z"}},{"id":"de-002551","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Gemeindearchiv Hainichen, Gemeindeverwaltung","parallelFormsOfName":["Hainichen Municipal Archive, Municipal Administration"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Dorfstr. 27","city":"Hainichen","region":"Sachsen","postalCode":"07778","country":"Germany","countryCode":"DE","email":[],"telephone":["(036427) 209"],"fax":["(036427) 209"],"url":[]},"geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[50.9358999,13.18204]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"de","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de-002551","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de-002551/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2018-07-09T11:19:48.513Z"}},{"id":"de-002706","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Stadtarchiv Vetschau","parallelFormsOfName":["Vetschau City Archive"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Stadtverwaltung, Schloßstr. 10","city":"Vetschau/Spreewald","region":"Brandenburg","postalCode":"03226","country":"Germany","countryCode":"DE","email":[],"telephone":["035433 / 7770 "],"fax":[],"url":[]},"geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[51.78288,14.07009]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"de","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de-002706","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de-002706/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2018-07-09T11:19:48.513Z"}},{"id":"de-002560","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Niedersächsisches Landesarchiv - Standort Hannover","parallelFormsOfName":["Lower Saxon State Archives - Hannover Branch"],"otherFormsOfName":["Niedersächsisches Landesarchiv - Hauptstaatsarchiv Hannover"],"address":{"streetAddress":"Am Archiv 1","city":"Hannover","region":"Niedersachsen","postalCode":"30169","country":"Germany","countryCode":"DE","email":["Hannover@nla.niedersachsen.de","poststelle@staatsarchiv-h.niedersachsen.de"],"telephone":["+49 (0) 511 120-6601"],"fax":["+49 (0) 511 120-6699"],"url":["http://www.nla.niedersachsen.de/portal/live.php?navigation_id=0","http://www.nla.niedersachsen.de/startseite/standorte/standort_hannover/standort-hannover-135671.html"]},"history":"Niedersächsisches Landesarchiv - Standort Hannover is responsible for the records of the highest authorities of Lower Saxony, as well as for all other offices of state administration in the former government district of Hannover.
