The Museum was first established in 1977 and housed in a small room next to the city’s synagogue. It housed objects salvaged from WW II, whether artifacts, documents and manuscripts of the 19th and 20th centuries, or the jewellery of the Jews of Thrace that had been seized by the Bulgarians in 1943. The latter had been returned to the Greek government after the abdication of the Bulgarian king and the establishment of a communist regime in the country. The following years saw a thorough and careful collection of material from all the communities of Greece, under the inspired guidance of Nikos Stavroulakis, director of the Museum until 1993. The collection expanded with rare books and publications, textiles, jewellery, domestic and religious artifacts, thanks to the interest of several individuals. The Museum soon began to attract the attention of many visitors, researchers and donors. In 1981, the Association of American Friends was founded, followed, a little later, by the Association of Friends of the Jewish Museum of Greece, with members of the Jewish Communities of Athens and Thessaloniki. After years of efforts, the Museum acquired its legal status in 1989, as a non-profit foundation with a seven-member Board of Directors. In the following years the Museum’s activities expanded; they involved both the research and study of the Greek Jews - in collaboration with other foundations and researchers from Greece and abroad - and publishing. At the same time, its collection was being continuously enriched with new acquisitions from all over Greece, greatly exceeding all expectations. ","records":"Ninety percent of all acquisitions come from donations, mainly by individuals from Greece and abroad. Otherwise, there is no systematic market research, nor is there an acquisitions budget.","buildings":"As the Museum’s collection grew and its activities expanded, it soon outgrew its first premises and new ones had to be found. In 1984, it moved to a rented space occupying the 3rd floor of 36, Amalias Avenue. The exhibition was reorganized into thematic units covering the interests of its various visitors. The increasing needs of the Museum for more space, together with the dream of sometime having its own premises, led to the purchase of a 19th century neoclassical building, with the support of its Friends in Greece and abroad, the Jewish Community of Thessaloniki and the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece. With substantial financial support from the Greek Ministry of Culture and the Associations of its Friends, the old building was renovated and, in late 1997, twenty years after it first opened its doors to the public, the Museum moved to 39 Nikis street, its new address in the centre of Athens. On March 10th, 1998, the new building of the JMG was inaugurated and a new area begun for the Museum. ","holdings":"The Museum’s collections include almost ten thousands original artifacts, testifying to more than 23 centuries of Jewish presence in Greece. Besides a few objects which Asher Moissis, president of the Jewish Community of Athens, had collected after the war, the core of the initial collection was made up of items that had been returned to Greece by the Bulgarian government, after the establishment of a communist regime in that country. These included personal effects, jewellery, domestic items, synagogual objects and documents, which belonged to the Jews of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace and were confiscated after 1941, when the area fell in the Bulgarian zone of occupation. The confiscated items had been meticulously recorded and became the first significant body of artifacts of the collection. This core material kept multiplying, mainly through the donations of individuals and communities, initially from the area of Thessaly, the island of Rhodes and the city of Ioannina. Besides rare 17th - 19th century books and publications, a significant number of ritual textiles was assembled, during the years 1977-1982. Most of them date from the Ottoman times (14th-19th centuries), and soon became one of the Museum’s main attractions, for both visitors and researchers. \r\n\r\nIn 1984 the Jewish Community of Patras was dissolved for lack of members and the interior of its synagogue, along with its textiles and ritual objects was bequeathed to the Museum. These religious artifacts are extremely significant, invaluable and irreplaceable, since they come, for the most part, from synagogues and communities, which no longer exist. After these early acquisitions, began the organization of the artifacts into categories: ritual objects, domestic and personal items, and Holocaust artifacts, documents, and information material. More donations from individuals and communities from both Greece and abroad continued to pour in, further enriching the collection. \r\n\r\nThe Museum’s relocation to its new premises (1998) brought a renewal of public interest and more donations followed. In general, the Museum has been receiving an average of 250-300 new artifacts every year, since the year 2000. Its unique collections, which are continuously being expanded, document more than four centuries of Jewish life in Greece, considering that the oldest textiles and antenuptial contracts date from the 16th century C.E. The original artifacts of the Museum’s collections are organised into various thematic categories. One of the largest is the category of Books, which includes Prayer books, Psalms, the Torah, Commentaries on Holy Texts, Kabbalah books, as well as school books, manuals of various kinds, books of history and ethnography, works of literature and poetry, calendars and albums dating as far back as the 16th century.Another significant and representative category is the one of Costumes, which includes traditional dress (18th–20th centuries) and urban outfits (19th–20th centuries), men’s, women’s and children’s clothing, and a wide variety of dress accessories. There are also clothes for infants, for circumcisions and prayer. A separate sub-category includes clothes that were traditionally part of a bride’s trousseau, such as hand-sewn underwear, shirts and nightshirts, dresses and household linen and textiles, for example bed sheets, towels, quilts, pillowcases, embroideries and lace items. Military uniforms and memorabilia make up another separate sub- category, while the Holocaust Collection includes concentration camp uniforms and a number of cloth yellow stars. There are a large number of synagogual textiles, either for use in rituals or decoration. Their variety ensures that all kinds are represented, of both the Romaniote and the Sephardic traditions. The Jewish Museum’s collections also include several synagogual artifacts, such as menorot, tikkim, rimonim, Torah scrolls, Torah pointers, tahshitim, as well as the furnishings of the Patras synagogue. Another category worth mentioning is the household objects, including crockery, cutlery, bowls and baking dishes, candle holders and more, as well as atrefacts for domestic rituals and worship, such as mezuzoth, hannukiyioth, spice containers, Shabbath candle holders and oil lamps. Many rare and important items are to be found in the category of manuscripts, including circumcision certificates (alefioth), antenuptial contracts (ketuboth), Esther Scrolls (meggiloth), personal diaries, a variety of correspondence, postcards and Ottoman decrees of the 19th century. The Museum also has a great number of documents, such as certificates, identity cards, passports, immigration and military papers, telegrams, stock certificates and bonds. Many of those are part of the Holocaust Collection. The Museum also has paintings, drawings, and engravings, original photographs and negatives, children’s toys, various kinds of shoes, coins and banknotes, dedicatory inscriptions and tombstones. Among the Museum’s collections, there are also archives of newspapers and clippings, WW II Archives, with rare historical documents, the Bulgarian Collection, containing jewellery, watches, lighters, personal items, valuables, documents, and its Collection of Works of Art. The newly formed Art Collection of the Jewish Museum of Greece contains contemporary works of art by Greek Jewish and non-Jewish artists, many of which have been exhibited in one or another of the Art Exhibitions frequently organised by the Museum, in its Contemporary Art Gallery. The Art Collection was formed as a response, first to the Museum’s desire to offer a more comprehensive view of its subject. Also, to the wish of its public to become acquainted–besides their history and tradition–with more aspects of the life and expression of the Greek Jews, such as their present artistic output, whether in music, literature or the fine arts. This collection also represents a widening of the scope of the Museum and a move towards artists beyond the community’s boundaries, as well as an effort to maintain and spur public interest by looking at issues of history, tradition, faith, identity, memory and coexistence from a new perspective. \r\n\r\n","openingTimes":"Opening hours: Monday to Friday: 9.00-14.30, Sundays: 10.00-14.00, \r\nSaturdays: closed.

In the Memorial Site the original sites of buildings and execution sites within the camp itself are marked by earth mounds and hollows. The path to the Flower Memorial is paved with railway sleepers. They denote symbolically part of the preserved railway track used to transport prisoners to the camp. Along with the memorial area, Jasenovac Memorial Site is responsible for the original, preserved camp building known as The Tower, the Stara Gradiška Camp cemetery, the Roma cemetery in Uštica and the mass graves in Krapje, Mlaka and Jablanac. Jasenovac Memorial Site, with the Memorial Museum, was founded in 1968 at the suggestion of the Federation of War Veterans' Organisations (SUBNOR) of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, Jasenovac Memorial Site and the Memorial Museum were founded“in order to preserve in perpetuity the remembrance of the victims of the Fascist terror and the soldiers of the People’s War of Liberation who fell in the Second World War in Jasenovac and Stara Gradiška Camps, and in order to preserve the achievements of Anti-Fascism.”(Act on Amendments to the Act on Jasenovac Memorial Site, OG 21/01). Jasenovac Concentration Camp was a place of imprisonment, forced labor and executions, primarily for the Serb Orthodox population which was, with the goal of creating an ethnically clean territory, to be completely eradicated from the Independent State of Croatia, as well as for Jews and Roma, who were discriminated against by racial laws. A large number of Croats was killed in the camp as well–communists and Anti-Fascists, members of the People’s Liberation Army of Croatia, as well as members of their families and other opponents of the Ustasha regime. The activities of Jasenovac Memorial Site have developed in different directions and include compiling, researching, scientifically processing, preserving and exhibiting the museum buildings and documents on how the Jasenovac Ustasha camp system operated; an educational programme; organising exhibitions and publications; ongoing co-operation with surviving prisoners and organising commemorative events in honour of the Jasenovac victims.Besides the Memorial Museum, the Education Centre is also part of Jasenovac Memorial Site. After the chaos of the 1991-1995 war in Croatia/ former Yugoslavia/, restoration followed, and the new permanent exhibition in the Jasenovac Memorial Site Memorial Museum was formally opened on 27 November 2006.Since it was impossible to display all the museum and archive material in a space of only 350 m², it was decided to adopt a multimedia approach, i.e. to present the museum inventory using different media, including photographic prints and documents, glass cabinet displays, digital presentations on screens, audio-visual presentations of survivor witness statements, etc. This method of presentation enabled visitors to the Museum to gain access to more information and allowed considerable more museum items to be presented than would have been possible using traditional displays.With this aim in mind, a database was created in which 65 topics were chronologically and thematically compiled in detail. An integral part of the database and the new permanent exhibition of the Memorial Museum of Jasenovac Memorial Site is the List of Individual Victims of Jasenovac Concentration Camp.","generalContext":"At the beginning of the Second World War, the village of Jasenovac had a mixed Croatian and Serbian population. All the local Serbs were expelled on 8 May 1942 by the Ustashas and sent to the camps in Jasenovac and Stara Gradiška, where some were killed and others sent to other camps in the Independent State of Croatia or the Third Reich. The Croatian villagers remained in their homes until 23 April 1945, when the Ustashas forced them to retreat with them to the west. The village of Jasenovac lived throughout the war years under a kind of camp regime, so that any contact between prisoners and villagers was extremely risky and anyone offering the prisoners help was in danger of being killed themselves. Since the buildings of Camp IV (Tannery) were in the centre of the village, and the villagers had to pass close by the largest part of the camp, Camp III (Brickworks) on the way to their fields, there was contact between them and some prisoners. The villagers would secretly throw corn cobs and bread over the fence, although they risked their lives in doing so. Others helped the camp Communist Party organisation and kept alive communications between the camp and the outside world.","holdings":"The museum was founded in 1968 and the memorial area Jasenovac has then started collecting documents from the Historical Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina; and the former Museum of revolution in Zagreb. Concerning the original material, it is mostly memories of survivors, items found in mass graves and personal items like photographs and documents, given to the Museum by the families. So, research-wise, the Museum does not hold significant material but it will remain a top priority for Croatia because Jasenovac was the largest concentration camp in the region, and its employees can give researchers advice on which other archive-holding institution they should contact if they are investigating a fate of a specific person, or about the conditions in general. \r\n\r\nThe institution provides (apart from the permanent exhibition) a list of individual victims of the Jasenovac concentration camp which is available to visitors and to the public for the first time since the opening of the Memorial Museum in 1968. From the more comprehensive list of vicitims of the WW2 on the area of former Yugoslavia, the museum has taken the names of all those whose deaths noted as having taken place in the Jasenovac Concentration Camp complex to come up with a final list of names(as final as possible).Hundreds of sources were used (books, documents, photographs, statements given by relatives and friends of the Jasenovac victims, field research and photographs of monuments to the victims of Fascist terrorism). The list contains biographical details of the victims (name and surname, father’s name, place, district and date of birth, ethnic affiliation), how the person met his or her death (means of death, person responsible, year and place of death, camp or execution site where the victim was killed) and information on the sources which were used in each individual case, as well as conflicting details from different sources for each victim. Working in this way, the museum has collected (until March 2013) a list of dates, names and details for 83,145 victims. According to the data gathered, 39,570 men, 23,474 women and 20,101 children under the age of 14 were killed in Jasenovac Concentration Camp.","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[45.2698097229004,16.9231395721436]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"hr","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/hr-002213","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/hr-002213/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/hr"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2018-07-09T11:19:48.513Z"}},{"id":"hr-005980","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Hrvatski institut za povijest","parallelFormsOfName":[],"otherFormsOfName":["Croatian History Institute"],"address":{"streetAddress":"Opatička 10","city":"Zagreb","postalCode":"10000","country":"Croatia","countryCode":"HR","email":["institut@isp.hr; mj@isp.hr"],"telephone":["+385 1 4851 721"],"fax":[],"url":["http://www.isp.hr"]},"history":"The Croatian Institute of History is the successor of the Institute of History of the Labor movement and the Croatian Institute for Contemporary History.

In 1959, after several transfers museum found home in a palace in the Upper Town. The place quickly proved too small for the storage and exhibition of the museum collection, which is one of the reasons that the museum does not have a permanent collection. In 1991 the Museum was merged with the Museum of the Revolution (founded in 1945 with the task of documenting the anti-fascist uprising in war-time Croatia) in a unique museum institution called the Croatian History Museum.Palace The museum is housed in a baroque palace Vojković-Oršić-Kulmer-Rauch in the Upper Town, built in the late 18th century.

Israel’s earliest national assemblies for Holocaust remembrance were held on the slopes beside the GFH Museum’s permanent location, an annual tradition that continues to this day.

These early interviews, covering a wide range of subjects and conducted according to highly professional standards, granted the ICJ the distinction of being the most important academic collection of oral documentation in Israel. Our collection of more than 10,000 interviews in 20 languages constitutes a unique treasure of Jewish memories whose importance cannot be underestimated. The collection includes testimonies on the Holocaust that were conducted in the early 1960s, when the reservoir of survivors (especially those who were adults during the war) was much larger and their memories less affected by the passage of time. Interviews were also conducted with key individuals involved in the Zionist movement, and other organizations such as the United Jewish Appeal, as well as with men and women who grew up under the British mandate in Palestine, under Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, or in various Jewish communities throughout the world.\r\n ","holdings":"The 900 Holocaust audio interviews and transcripts reflect the vast scope of oral histories collected by researchers which have been archived at the Oral History Division of the Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. They include interviews conducted in the early 1960s when the reservoir of survivors (especially those who were adults during the war) was much larger and for many survivors these interviews were the first time they had given an account of their experiences. The collection developed over the past 60 years as more research was undertaken by established and emerging scholars and questions relating to the experience of Jews under Nazism broadened. Thus, this collection not only gives voice to the experiences of individual survivors but also reflects the development of research and inquiry into this difficult past. This resource should provide an invaluable tool for researchers in Holocaust studies.\r\n","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[31.79614,35.2356399]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"il","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/il-002784","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/il-002784/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/il"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2018-07-09T11:19:48.513Z"}},{"id":"jp-005465","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Gaimushō Gaikō Shiryōkan","parallelFormsOfName":["Diplomatic Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan / The Diplomatic Record Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"5-3, 1-chome, Azabudai, Minatoku","city":"Tokyo","postalCode":"106-0041","country":"Japan","countryCode":"JP","email":[],"telephone":["03 (3585) 4511"],"fax":["03 (3585) 4514"],"url":["http://www.mofa.go.jp/about/hq/record/index.html"]},"history":"The Diplomatic Archives was opened on April 15,1971 as an archive facility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nSince 1868, the first year of the Meiji Period, the Foreign Ministry has kept, classified, and preserved records of the Ministry and has paid great attention to the compilation and publication of such documents.\r\n\r\nAs the former Foreign Minister Kikujiro Ishii once said, \"whether documentation is complete or not determines success in foreign policy.\" Unfortunately, however, a large number of vital documents were destroyed by fire in the bombing of Tokyo during World War II. Since the War, the Ministry has focused on collecting and restoring documents lost in the wartime confusion and requesting former Allied Powers to return seized documents, as well as organizing existing papers.\r\n\r\nSince 1936 the Ministry has been publishing the Nihongaikobunsho (Documents on Japanese Foreign Policy), a chronological anthology of important documents collected from its archives , in order to contribute to greater understanding of foreign policy.\r\n\r\nIn the postwar era, especially after the Treaty of Peace with Japan signed in San Francisco in 1951, interest in the history of foreign policy has risen, which has in turn spurred rapid advances in research. The chronicles at Japan's Foreign Ministry have thus began to draw considerable attention and expectation from researchers and experts in the areas of diplomatic history, international politics, and other academic disciplines. The Ministry, however, had lacked the facilities to permit full access to its archives nor the staffing needed for full-scale archival management.\r\n\r\nIn response to requests from foreign policy researchers and experts to establish an archive comparable to those in Western nations, and because of the lack of space to keep prewar records in its archive, the Ministry established the Diplomatic Archives to preserve records from the end of the Tokugawa Period to the end of World War II in 1971.\r\n\r\nIn July 1988, the Annex was built to house an exhibition room, a library, a storage room and an administrative office. The Annex was donated by the late Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru Memorial Foundation.","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[35.6899261474609,139.691757202148]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"jp","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/jp-005465","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/jp-005465/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/jp"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2018-07-09T11:19:48.513Z"}},{"id":"kg-005588","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Tsentralny Gosudarstvenny Arkhiv Kirgizskoy Respubliki","parallelFormsOfName":["Central State Archive of the Kyrgyz Republic"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"city":"Bishkek","country":"Kyrgyzstan","countryCode":"KG","email":[],"telephone":[],"fax":[],"url":[]},"geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[42.8843383789062,74.6035385131836]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"kg","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/kg-005588","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/kg-005588/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/kg"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2018-07-09T11:19:48.513Z"}},{"id":"nl-002994","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Brabants Historisch Informatie Centrum","parallelFormsOfName":["Brabant Historic Information Center"],"otherFormsOfName":["BHIC"],"address":{"streetAddress":"Zuid-Willemsvaart 2","city":"s-Hertogenbosch","postalCode":"5211 NW","country":"Netherlands","countryCode":"NL","email":["info@bhic.nl"],"telephone":["+31 (0)73 - 681 85 00"],"fax":["+31 (0)73 - 614 64 39"],"url":["http://www.bhic.nl/"]},"generalContext":"The Brabant Historical Information Center (BHIC) operates in the province of North Brabant, and in particular 17 municipalities and 2 water boards (Aa and Maas, De Dommel).","holdings":"The Brabant Historical Information Center (BHIC) manages over 1,500 archives and collections (almost 30 km of paper and parchment); helps not only individuals but also organizations, institutions, municipalities, provincial institutions with all their questions in the field of archives and cultural; is the main center for genealogy in Brabant; is the main center for the history of Brabant; is the main center for local history in northeastern North Brabant (blue municipalities).","openingTimes":"The Brabant Historical Information Center (BHIC) is open from Tuesday to Friday from 9am to 4pm and every first Saturday of the month from 9am to 4pm.","accessibility":"The Brabant Historical Information Center (BHIC) has its own parking lot.","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[51.69458,5.30307]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"nl","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/nl-002994","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/nl-002994/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/nl"},"meta":{"subitems":48,"updated":"2018-07-09T11:19:48.513Z"}},{"id":"nl-002978","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Oorlogs en verzetsmuseum","parallelFormsOfName":["National War and Resistance Museum"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Meuseumplein 1","city":"Overloon","postalCode":"5825 AM","country":"Netherlands","countryCode":"NL","email":["info@oorlogsmuseum.nl"],"telephone":["31 47 864 12 50"],"fax":["31 47 864 24 05"],"url":["http://www.oorlogsmuseum-overloon.nl/uk/"]},"geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[51.5712585449219,5.94637012481689]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"nl","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/nl-002978","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/nl-002978/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/nl"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2018-07-09T11:19:48.513Z"}},{"id":"pl-003154","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Biblioteka Uniwersytecka we Wrocławiu","parallelFormsOfName":["Wrocław University Library"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"ul.

In the organizational structure of the archive works An Office for the Former Prisoners (Biuro ds. Byłych Więźniów). It issues certificates for the former prisoners and their families are concerning the inprisonment. Its task is also a coordination of contacts between former prisoners.","administrativeStructure":"Some 1,100,000 European Jews from Hungary, Poland, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Bohemia and Moravia, Slovakia, Belgium and many other countries , as well as many prisoners of other nationalities and Soviet prisoners of war, perished in KL Auschwitz-Birkenau. From 1942 the Birkenau camp operated as an extermination camp. In spite of the destruction, the documentation from KL Auschwitz-Birkenau constitutes one of the best preserved bodies of camp files, running to more than 200 linear metres of original documents. The surviving materials have been divided into the following collections (all files are ordered by issuer):\r\n\r\n•\tAkta Oddziału I – Kommandantur (Files from Department I – camp commandant’s office): orders (more than 230), files relating to the SS (around 3 linear metres of personnel files), files concerning prisoners (mail, releases, escapes – including telegrams sent after escaped prisoners).\r\n•\tAkta Oddziału II – Politische Abteilung (Files from Department II – Political Dept.) , the camp Gestapo: transport lists dating from 1941 and the lists of some transports of Jews from 1942 (Zuganglisten – arrivals lists) – around 3 linear metres, prisoners’ personal files (Häftlingspersonalbogen) – around 3 linear metres, personal files of Soviet POWs (48) and Greek Jews, records of deaths (Sterbebücher) – 46 volumes, and disciplinary reports on “crimes” committed by prisoners.\r\n•\tAkta Oddziału III – Schutzhaftlagerführung (Files from Department III – camp director): a few of the main record books (including two books from the Roma family camp), the record book for the penal company, the bunker record book, the card files for Soviet POWs (around 3.5 linear metres), two volumes of the Stärkebuch (the records of the daily counts), the main Nummerbuch (book of numbers), two record books for Blocks 16 and 4, a card file for prisoners in Block 11, and punishment reports.\r\n•\tAkta Oddziału IIIa – Arbeitseinsatz (Files from Department IIIa – labour details): correspondence (3 binders, in all 391 items, dating from 1943) – chiefly detailing prisoner handovers, lists – i.e. daily breakdowns of numbers of prisoners in labour details (including around 200 breakdowns from the women’s camp in Birkenau); in light of the original breakdowns for various periods (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.), the preserved documentation represents a very small fraction, though it does offer a certain insight into the nature of employment (which included experimentation), prisoner numbers, and the places they worked.\r\n•\tAkta Oddziału IV – Verwaltung (Files from Department IV - administration): food ration cards for the SS officers, orders for the workshops, authorizations for transportation, orders for wood and coke for the crematoria, and blank forms and other printed materials (in all around 2.5 linear metres).\r\n•\tAkta Oddziału V – Standortarzt (Files from Department V – camp doctor): various documents, including lists of patient names, patient histories, hospital ledgers, lists of medications, and reports to the Political Department on the removal of gold dentures and on cremation of bodies.\r\n•\tAkta Oddziału VI – Truppenbetreuung (Files from Department VI – Troop Supplies): no files have been preserved.\r\n•\tAkta Oddziału VII – Landwirtschaft (Files from Department VII – Farm): 1 binder of correspondence (in the village of Rajsko there were gardens and an experimental cultivation programme of the plant kok-saghyz for an ersatz rubber supply).\r\n•\tAkta Centralnego Zarządu Budowlanego Formacji Wojskowej SS i Policji w Oświęcimiu (Zentralbauleitung der Waffen-SS u.

Many of the plans for barracks, buildings, crematoria and gas chambers, as well as plans for further projects have been preserved, as have lists of prisoners employed, correspondences, and stamps. Many of the Construction Board files (around 60%) are now in Moscow archives (the originals) and in the PMAB Archive (copies).\r\n•\tAkta Instytutu Higieny (SS Hygiene Institute Auschwitz, Bakteriologische Untersuchungsstelle Süd-Ost): chiefly results of analyses performed for the SS hospital and for camp prisoners (in all, including correspondences, around 8.5 linear metres, 64 volumes).\r\n•\tAkta podobozów oświęcimskich (Files from Auschwitz sub-camps, including those in Brzeszcze, Jaworzno, Trzebionka and Goleszów): letters written by prisoner labourers and official letters from the camp doctor; these materials have survived in very poor condition (in all approx. 4 linear metres).\r\n•\tBilety kolejowe Żydów z Grecji (Train tickets of Jews from Greece).\r\n•\tWspomnienia (Memoirs) – 251 volumes; 1,446 separate texts, approx. 56,000 pages.\r\n•\tOświadczenia (Accounts) – 161 volumes; around 3,500 statements by former prisoners, forced labourers and local residents, approx. 30,348 pages.\r\n•\tAnkiety (Questionnaires) – 192 volumes (filled in by former prisoners, approx. 20,000 pages).\r\n•\tAnkiety tematyczne (Themed questionnaires disseminated among former prisoners by Stanisław Kłodziński for the periodical Przegląd Lekarski (27 volumes, 7,901 pages).\r\n•\tKampfgruppe Auschwitz – original files of the camp resistance movement, including notes passed to prisoners by members of the Polish underground formation Armia Krajowa (AK, Home Army) and other people, e.g. J.

Besides recordings of around 2,000 interviews with former prisoners, there is also a collection of feature films and documentaries, and a very extensive photographic archive. The museum also has a vast number of items salvaged from the camp, and other exhibits connected with the camp and its functioning. These will be profiled as a group in Part II of the Guide (Chapter 13). On a final note, it is worth stressing that documentation held in Russian archives has been partially copied and is accessible in this form at PMAB.  The museum library has a specialist collection (currently in excess of 30,000 volumes), including – aside from maps, atlases and encyclopedias – special collections of books and periodicals published in the Third Reich.\r\n\tIn 2006 the museum opened an International Center for Education about Auschwitz and the Holocaust.\r\nThe collections of the museum’s archive are constantly being expanded, chiefly through the efforts of the Biuro ds. Współpracy z Byłymi Więźniami (Bureau for Cooperation with Former Prisoners), which gathers a full range of information on former prisoners. Prisoner data is currently being entered into a centralized computer database, Repozytorium Cyfrowe (Digital Repository). The most important databases being created by PMAB are as follows:\r\n\r\n•\tRepozytorium Cyfrowe Muzeum (the Digital Repository), a project aiming to enter into a single, unified database all information on former prisoners irrespective of source. At present some 650,000 records have been entered into the database from original SS documents (70 fonds of former camp documents), including:\r\n \r\n−\t28,000 records of data from Häftlings-Personal-Kartei KL Mauthausen,\r\n−\t24,000 records from the card file Lagerschreibstube KL Mauthausen,\r\n−\t30,000 records of data referring to various photographs,\r\n−\tover 13,000 records from the hospital ledger from Block 28,\r\n−\tover 25,000 records from the Monowitz hospital ledgers,\r\n–\tover 31,000 records from the Roentgen (x-ray) ledgers.\r\n\r\nIn the future a full database will permit rapid access to, and statistical processing and analysis of information:\r\n\r\n•\tOnline database containing source data on the victims of the camp). Information may be sought in this database by: given name, surname, occupation, camp number, date of birth, place of birth, and place of residence. The data available here come from just two of the scores of archival fonds that exist: the Death Books and the records ledgers from the Sinti and Roma camp. This means that there is online information on former prisoners for around 180,000 of those who perished in the camp. The fuller database on former prisoners, which has not been made available online, is still under construction by PMAB archivists. For more accurate information, contact the Office for Information on Former Prisoners at the museum.\r\n\r\n•\tA database of death certificates, compiled on the basis of preserved Death Books (Totenbücher) of prisoners at KL Auschwitz. In 46 volumes of file, the Politische Abteilung (the Political Dept., the camp Gestapo) recorded the deaths of almost 69,000 registered prisoners between 29 July 1941 and 31 Dec. 1943. For this reason the database does not include the names of most of the Jews deported to KL Auschwitz, who arrived at the camp in mass transports and for the most part underwent selection at once and were sent to their deaths. Where a death certificate does exist, it includes the following information: certificate number, date of issue, given name and surname, religion, place of residence, date of death, time of death, place of death (always Kasernenstrasse [“Barracks Street”] Auschwitz, not the camp), date and place of birth, father’s given name and surname, mother’s given name and surname, spouse’s given name and surname, name of the doctor confirming the death, date, signature, and cause of death (fictional).

That Library opened to the public in 1747. It was one of the first libraries in the world intended to fulfill the tasks of a modern library in developing collections covering the entire body of Polish literature and making those works accessible to the public. In 1780 the Polish Parliament [the Sejm] granted the Library the right to receive a free legal deposit copy of every book printed in the country.\r\n\r\nAfter Warsaw was invaded by Russian troops in 1794, the collections of the library were taken as war booty to St. Petersburg where they formed the core of the newly founded Imperial Library. The collections taken to Russia numbered 394,150 volumes, including about 11,000 manuscripts and over 24,500 etchings. After Poland was partitioned in three, the idea of the national library was cultivated by other book repositories, and primarily by foundation libraries of Polish aristocratic families who – beside national literature – also made efforts to collect and protect other memorabilia of national heritage. Many treasures of national literature held in foundation libraries were later incorporated in the National Library’s collections, the building of which began immediately after Poland regained independence in 1918.\r\n\r\nThe reconstituted holdings of the National Library included the collections of the Załuski Library previously taken to Russia and restituted from the Soviet Union over the period of 1923–1935, as well as the collections of other Warsaw-based libraries and the collections from Rapperswil and Paris created by Polish émigré communities and transferred to Poland.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II the most valuable part of the National Library’s holdings – almost 800,000 registered items – was lost forever. The Library’s special collection was almost completely destroyed, including ca. 50,000 manuscripts, 2,500 incunabula, 80,000 early printed books, and 100,000 drawings and engravings. The few most precious treasures evacuated to Canada survived the ravages of war: this included the earliest manuscript records in the Polish language: the mid 14th century Kazania świętokrzyskie [The Holy Cross Sermons] and the late 14th century Psałterz floriański [Psalterium trilingue – The Sankt Florian Psalter].","records":"The National Library acts as the central library of the state and one of the most important cultural institutions in Poland. Its mission is to protect national heritage preserved in the form of handwritten, printed, electronic, recorded sound and audiovisual documents. The primary task of the National Library is to acquire, store and permanently archive the intellectual output of Poles, whether the works of citizens living on Polish soil, the most important foreign works, or publications related to Poland and published abroad.\r\n\r\nFollowing this fundamental function, the National Library is also responsible for a number of tasks that are of crucial importance to Polish culture. Serving as the chief archive of Polish literary output, the National Library is also a national bibliographic agency, a large research library focusing on the humanities, as well as a nationally and internationally recognized centre of preservation and conservation. It also fulfills a surpassing role in research, documentation and methodological activity in bibliography, library science and reading, and related areas connected with the social circulation of the book.

As the date of foundation 05 May 1919 is taken, when the Decree of organization of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (MIP), diplomatic and consular missions of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, was passed. As one of the organization units, the Main Archive was founded on the basis of the Decree, and it consisted of Documentation and Library of the Ministry, taken over from the Ministry of the Kingdom of Serbia and Montenegro. The Main Archive started to operate more effectively in the fall of 1924 since it was then that the Minister of Foreign Affairs formed an expert commission whose task was to inspect gathered documents on the creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and make a plan of future operation of the Main archive.\r\nThe Law on archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and diplomatic and consular missions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia abroad has from 05 April 1930 been precise in stating which holdings of the archive would become part of the Main Archive. Those were the archives of former Ministries of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Montenegro and their missions abroad, as well as foreign diplomatic and consular archives or correspondence, which belong to our country according to international contracts, or which were given to the State by foreign states, to preserve. Under the same conditions, the Law protected private archives as well, which had, as a gift, by means of purchase or any other, become part of any of the archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or missions of the Kingdom abroad.\r\n\r\nEver since that time, destroyed documents or damaged papers are being reconstructed; the scientific and other research is granted to private persons according to regulations; diplomatic documents of interest for the national history are being published; the research in foreign archives and papers of foreign documents concerning the national history; arrangement and preservation of holdings of interest to our diplomatic history; participation in signing and implementation of international contracts and conventions concerning the archives.\r\nBy the Decree with legal power, on organizing of MFA and DCM (Diplomatic and Consular Missions) of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia abroad from 10 August 1939, the Main archive was reorganized by becoming the History Department whose competence included:\r\n\r\n    arrangement, technical processing and keeping of old archives of all departments of the Ministry and diplomatic and consular missions and delegations for which it is necessary to be transferred to this department;\r\n    retrieving of all missing or lost papers referred to by the Law on archives of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and diplomatic and consular missions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia abroad.\r\n\r\nThe Library of the Ministry was part of the History Department, and was interrupted by the war for the period of almost four years. At that time, the Archive suffered irretrievable damage due to destruction of material and its transfer to Germany, and later to the USSR.\r\n\r\nThe History Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Federative Yugoslavia began to operate in March 1945. The needs of the new Ministry soon started to enlarge, and therefore the History Department was soon organized into three sections - Diplomatic Archive, Documentation and Library. The Diplomatic Archive soon became independent as a separate organization unit of the Ministry. From March 1945 until the middle of 1949, it mainly dealt with restitution of documents taken from our country in the course of the Second World War. Due to the external danger, to which Yugoslavia was exposed at the time, the Diplomatic Archive was closed again in 1949, and the documents transferred in the country's province. It started to operate by the end of 1957 in Dubrovnik, in the old building of the Benedictine monastery St. Jacob. In 1960 it was moved to Belgrade, and is since 1961, permanently open for scientific research.\r\nSince its foundation, the Diplomatic Archive had performed a conventional archival function, with the organization of work similar to archives of other Ministries in the world. It is a specialized archive necessary for the regular operation of the Ministry and other institutions of the country in charge of activities concerning foreign affairs, as well as scientific research.\r\n\r\nThe basic task of the Diplomatic Archive is systematic gathering, arranging and preservation of material resulted from the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and diplomatic and consular missions, as well as the use of the material for scientific, cultural, educational, informative and operational needs.\r\n\r\nBy dividing of competence in 1981, the complete archive of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Serbia and its diplomatic and consular missions, from the period of 1854-1918, in total 128 files, was handed over to the Archive of Serbia.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of Article 46 of the Archive material of the Federation Law (Official Register of the SFRY No. 11, March 7 1986), the archive material of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and its diplomatic and consular missions for the period of 1918-1945, as well as the material which was not made by the Ministry, was handed over to the Archives of Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\nOut of all archive holdings of the Kingdom of Serbia and Kingdom of Montenegro, in other words, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Ministry (Foreign Legal Affairs Service) is only in possession of the Collection of international contracts, which, together with the contracts of the Republic of Yugoslavia, makes 9,840 files of bilateral contracts and 1,622 files of multilateral contracts (all computer processed).\r\n\r\nThe Diplomatic Archive today handles 132 holdings resulting from the work of the Ministry and its missions in the period from 1945. year till today, which consist of materials from bilateral and multilateral activity of our country. The information means - registers of material, books and guides to the archive material and depots - were also made.\r\n\r\nThe use of the archive material in the Diplomatic Archive is done on basis of the Regulations for use of archive material (Official Register of the SFRY No. 49, July 25 1987) and may be accessed for purposes of research or any other, after 30 years since its foundation. The archive also includes a reading room and information card catalog about the users.\r\n\r\nThe Diplomatic Archive has published the collections of public documents on foreign affairs of the SFRY from 07 March 1945-1950, by the name of Blue edition in eight volumes:\r\n\r\n    The Documents on foreign affairs of the SFRY from 1945, published by Yugoslav Survey, Belgrade, 1984;\r\n    The Documents on foreign affairs of the SFRY from 1946, both the volumes 1 and 2, Yugoslav Survey, Belgrade, 1985;\r\n    The Documents on foreign affairs of the SFRY from 1947, volume 1, Yugoslav Survey, Belgrade, 1985, and volume 2, Yugoslav Survey, Belgrade 1986;\r\n    The Documents on foreign affairs of the SFRY from 1948, Yugoslav Survey, Belgrade, 1989;\r\n    The Documents on foreign affairs of the SFRY from 1949, Yugoslav Survey, Belgrade 1991;\r\n    The Documents on foreign affairs of the SFRY from 1950, Yugoslav Survey, Belgrade, 1993.\r\n\r\nAs well as the collection of documents from the period of 1941-1945; documents on foreign affairs of the SFRY from 1941-1945, volume 1, Yugoslav Survey, Belgrade, 1988 and volume 2, Yugoslav Survey, Belgrade, 1989.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the FRY and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation have published a document code Relations between Yugoslavia and Russia (USSR) 1941-1945.\r\n\r\nThe Code was published by the Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Military Historic Institute and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, in Belgrade, 1996, in Serbian language.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation published, in 2010, a collection of documents entitled \"Yugoslav-Soviet Relations 1945-1956\", in Serbian and Russian.","holdings":"In accordance with law and internal regulations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia, the archives of the Ministry (from 1945 to date) are now available and may be accessed to 30 years after they have been established (in 2013, including the year 1982).
