The first one dates back to the end of 1920s, when Bukovina was a part of the Kingdom of Romania. Except for one document in the archive of the Chernivtsi oblast, no other signs of the proposed museum were found.\r\n\r\nThe second effort was made in the end of 1990s by the Jewish Steinbarg Society.

Its first resources were document created before 1848 which by then were already not in the administration usage. Its first location was a room in one of the university buildings at Nicholas st. 4 (today Hrushevskoho 4). \r\n\r\nFirst directior of the Archives was   professor of Lviv University Ludwik Finkel (1894-1930 years), who at that time taught history at the Faculty of Philosophy and had considerable experience in Archival service. \r\n\r\nIn the years 1894-1898 archive was in a process of organization, collecting, recording and systematizing acquired material.  \r\n\r\nOver the next decade Archive staff worked and registered enourmous on records from 1785-1805.  At that time archive is becoming more and more popular among the Polish researchers (from 1871 Lviv University was a Polish University). \r\n\r\n During I World War I Archive have not experienced significant losses as the most valuable of its materials were taken to Vienna or deposited in the Museum of Dzieduszyckis. The main part of the archival fond stayed at the University and was closely monitored by its staff.\r\n\r\nArchive continue to operate and develop in Interwar period. It published its new thematically organized inventory. Since the archival fond was constantly growing in 1930 Archive was moved to the new building at \r\nMarshalkovska 1 ( street today . 1 University ) , where he was placed on the first floor. In the same year first director of the archive L. Finkel passes away. \r\n\r\nAfter his death Theophilus Modelsky, known palaeographer and medievalist, becames a new archive director . Modelsky was a former student of Finkel, himself already an renown scholar with a archival experience. \r\n\r\nIn 1930s Archive is expanding not only collecting documents from the various University departments but copying documents connected to the history of the University from the other archives. This decade is the time of dynamic development of the Archive, its growing cooperation with other Polish and European archives and libraries. \r\n\r\nIn the years 1939-1941 after the Soviet conquest of Lviv new authorities changed the organization and general source of the authority of the archive. \r\n   \r\nIn 1949, the Archive again was established as a separate unit. From 1947 they were operating under supervision of the State Regional Archives. At that time University lost its importance, together with interest of its history, what affected situation of the Archive.  Soviet archival principles did not provide opportunities for archivists to actively participate in research or to build relationships with scientific institutions in the country , let alone abroad.

It was remodelled several times before 1450, once probably in 1348, following an earthquake. After the expulsion of the Jews from Styria and Maribor at the end of the 15th Century the synagogue was converted into a Church of All Saints in 1501. The building functioned as a church until the late 18th century. In the early 19th century it was sold and turned into a storehouse. The building was then divided horizontally into two parts. Eventually, the upper part was used as a dwelling. During the early 1980s the lower floor was used for exhibitions.\r\n\r\nThe renovation interventions started in the 1990s. It was not easy to decide which of the last 3 initial phases to reconstruct. Most material finds (besides key-stones also parts of ribs, consoles and portals) date from the last synagogue phase (the mid-15th century). A reconstruction of the late Gothic two-bay sanctuary was therefore made, following the indications of the assembled material.

The area was strongly influenced by a mixture of cultural influences from the neighbouring countries and regions, as well as by a unique creative spirit deeply rooted in the ethnical, national and religious diversity of the region.\r\n\r\nThe Museum was established in 1955 on the basis of the collection of the Prekmurje Museum Association. In addition to special collections, the Museum also preserves important archaeological, ethnological and cultural-historical material. Part of the latter is put on display at the Permanent exhibition at the Murska Sobota Castle. The exhibition won the Museum a special award from the European Museum Forum in 1999. The Museum houses a restoration workshop and a rich professional library. It is also involved in publishing, the most important product being a periodical named the Anthology of the Murska Sobota Museum.","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[46.6626,16.16055]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"si","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/si-006013","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/si-006013/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/si"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2018-07-09T11:19:48.513Z"}},{"id":"sm-006015","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Archivio di Stato","parallelFormsOfName":["State Archive "],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"country":"San Marino","countryCode":"SM","email":[],"telephone":[""],"fax":[],"url":["http://www.sanmarino.sm/on-line/home/pubblica-amministrazione/dipartimenti/articolo44003370.html"]},"holdings":"\r\n","openingTimes":"08:30 to 14:00 from Monday to Friday\r\n15:00 to 17:45 Monday and Thursday afternoon","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[43.9381523132324,12.4634971618652]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"sm","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/sm-006015","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/sm-006015/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/sm"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2018-07-09T11:19:48.513Z"}},{"id":"gr-006021","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Ιστορικό Αρχείο της Ιεράς Συνόδου της Εκκλησίας της Ελλάδος","parallelFormsOfName":["The Historic Archive of the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece","Istoriko Archeio tis Ieras Synodou tis Ekklisias tis Ellados"],"otherFormsOfName":["IAISEE"],"address":{"contactPerson":"Prof. Spyridon Kondogiannis, Director","streetAddress":"Deinokratous 68","city":"Athens","region":"Region of Attika","postalCode":"TK 11521","country":"Greece","countryCode":"GR","email":["iaee@ecclesia.gr"],"telephone":["(0030)2130234484"],"fax":["(0030)2130234484"],"url":[]},"history":"The Church of Greece was declared autocephalous in 1833.

The staff of the Central Library submitted a set of proposals, which were discussed at a meeting of the University’s Council on 10th March 1971 and the decision to establish an archive was made. As certain conditions necessary to receive the status of a specialised archives had not yet been met, the Archives was established as a section of the Central Library in 1972 and the professional organisation of the accumulated material began. The publication of an inventory of the Archives’ records prior to 1960 completed the process in 1975. The further collection of historically important records was prevented by a lack of space at the time but this obstacle was eliminated in 1984 by the opening of the Archives’ new premises. This created the ideal conditions for the work of the Archives to progress (the collection and organisation of records as well as the research and data service). On 1st January 1993, the Archive was finally given “specialised archive” status. It also participated in the foundation of the Budapest-Gödöllő Archives’ Association the same year, acting as one of its founding members. (The Association changed its name to the Hungarian University and College Archives’ Association in 1996 and then to the Hungarian University Higher Education Archives Association in 2001.) Construction work commenced in 2012 to refurbish the new premises of the Archives in the central building of the University. The Archives’ new office, research room and storeroom were inaugurated in festive circumstances on 13th March 2013.","generalContext":"Budapest University of Technology and Economics","holdings":"The holdings of the Archives amount to nearly 1,500 linear meters of records dating from the time period 1846-2000. No documents relating to the predecessor institution of the Universoty, named Institutum Geometricum, have been preserved (except one engineering diploma). The archival material of this engineer training institute was held by the Budapest Science University until 1850, as the institute had been an integral part of this University. These documents were, however, destroyed, so researchers can only rely on secondary sources (on the material of the central feudal government authorities in the National Archives of Hungary). Our material has, however, been continuous from 1846, the year of the foundation of Joseph College of Technology, especially as far as the documents of the Director's and Rector's offices are concerned. The majority of the students' records have been preserved (register books, records of comprehensive, state and doctoral exams). The material of the Archives was damaged for the first time and the most seriously in the 2nd World War, when the documents of several faculties were destroyed (except student records). The documentary material of the University was next badly damaged during the great document selection campaign in the 1950s. The documents were again damaged, mainly mixed up, during the Hungarian revolution in 1956.\r\n","openingTimes":"Budapest University of Technology and Economics Archive is open to researchers on Mondays to Thursdays from 9:00 to 16:00 and on Fridays from 9:00 to 12:00.

In 1919-1921 it was involved in collecting information about the victims of national uprisings and the transfer of information to prisoners of war. Office also took part in the reception of Polish political prisoners coming from the Soviet Union at the Polish border and was looking for their families and documents.\r\nWith the outbreak of World War II the Office began to prepare lists of the dead, the wounded, sick and missing. A database of names was created. On 23 September 1939 the seat of the Office of Information and Tracing was bombed. Workers were trying to protect the remainder of the documents. The Red Cross branches in various Polish cities organized Sections of Information and Research. Information was collected from parish and municipal offices and from private individuals. In the temporary camps for prisoners of war, Polish Red Cross registered the prisoners and participated in the transmission of letters from their families.\r\nSince December 1939 Polish Red Cross Delegations started their activities in many countries. They conducted searching of Polish citizens, both military and civilian, and prepared the database of Polish of prisoners of war, staying in Oflag and Stalag camps. Thousands of requests for search were sent and much information about persons deported and interned was obtained. Thus a new Office database was created.\r\nAfter the discovery in 1943 of the mass graves of Polish officers murdered in Katyn, the Technical Committee of the Polish Red Cross was appointed, which  led the exhumation in the period from April until June 1943. Thanks to the work of the Commission the list was prepared by the Delegation of the Polish Red Cross in Geneva, comprising 2805 names. For a long time it was the only basis for the issuance of certificates to the families of victims.\r\nOn August 2, 1944, during the Warsaw Uprising, the Office of Information and Tracing has been set on fire by SS. Then the painstakingly created database comprising over 1 500 000  cards was burnt down, together with thousands of valuable documents. Again the Office began to write down losses and to prepare site plans of temporary graves for the future exhumation. Hospitals of the Polish Red Cross prepared the lists of the names of the sick, the wounded and the dead, and then, if possible, the family were notified. On 21 October, 1944, employees of the Office together with the whole of the material collected had to leave Warsaw. Office facilities opened in many places. Families were informed about the fate of people evacuated from Warsaw.\r\nAfter the war, the most urgent thing was to find the children sent to Germany by the \"Lebensborn\". The number of Polish children submitted to Germanization was estimated on 200 000. Delegations of the Polish Red Cross in Germany were supposed to find the children and to reclaim them. Office of Information and Tracing in Warsaw transferred the lists of missing children to the Delegations in Germany. Polish Red Cross was also receiving transports of children from Germany and Austria. In the years 1946-1948 tens of thousands of children returned to Poland.\r\nAnother important task was the exhumation of war graves, conducted with the participation of the Red Cross throughout the country. In some places the municipal and county offices led the exhumations, and documents were forwarded to the Office of Information and Tracing, permitting to identify thousands of individuals. Collected and recorded were also accounts of people who witnessed mass executions. Information and Tracing Office also led the search for the graves of foreigners, dead and fallen on Polish territory.\r\nAfter the war the Information and Tracking Office took over the files of the Polish Red Cross  Delegations operating abroad, local branches of the Polish Red Cross, the materials received from the Allied military authorities, the International Committee of the Red Cross, many documents were transferred from the Main Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes in Poland.\r\nThe Office of Infromation and Tracing participated in the action of helping former prisoners of Nazi concentration camps, subjected to pseudo-medical experiments. In 1960. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany has decided to grant a one-time financial assistance to surviving victims of pseudo-medical experiments performed in Nazi concentration camps. Due to the lack of diplomatic relations between Poland and the FRG, assistance was obtained through the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. Polish Red Cross has been authorized to represent the interests of the Polish victims at the ICRC. The Office gathered all the documentation on these matters and transferred it to ICRC.\r\nIn the last few years, the Office has issued about 30 000 certificates proving stay in concentration camps, forced labor and prisons on the basis of the documents submitted by former prisoners or obtained from domestic and foreign archives as a result of the efforts taken by the Office.
