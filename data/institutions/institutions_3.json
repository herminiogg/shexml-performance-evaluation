The aim of the Centre was to document “the social question” and to “make this collection available free-of-charge to all interested parties”. The initiative was taken by Paul Pflüger, a social reformer and pastor from the working-class district of Aussersihl. Inspired by a visit to the Musée Social in Paris on the occasion of the 1900 World Exhibition, Paul Pflüger devoted himself intensively to documenting the social question. The association had a non-partisan composition right from the start. All the key political and denominational directions were represented, in order to ensure that the newly-created institution worked on a scientifically objective basis.\r\n\r\nIn January 1907, the reading room and lending service were launched in a two-room flat at Seilergraben 31. For the first few years, the “Centre for Social Literature” was run as a one-man undertaking. The first person in charge was Gustav Büscher; he was succeeded in 1909 by Sigfried Bloch who, together with his wife, Rosa Bloch-Bollag, was a prominent representative of the Swiss labour movement at that time. In 1919, the “Centre” was able to move into new and bigger premises on the ground floor of the former chancel of the “Predigerkirche”.\r\nUnder its new manager, Paul Kägi (1929-1941), the Centre increased its staff numbers slightly – three permanent jobs were created for looking after the reading room and performing the increasing amount of cataloguing and office work. During the economic crisis, the Centre was also able to take on so-called “public relief workers” for longer or shorter periods of time.\r\n\r\nThe institution then underwent considerable expansion between 1942 and 1946 under its new manager, Eugen Steinemann. When Eugen Steinemann took up office in 1942, the name of the institute was also changed to “Swiss Social Archives”.\r\n\r\nOn 2 June 1957, the Swiss Social Archives were able to move into a new building at Neumarkt 28. The move had necessitated long, drawn-out negotiations with the municipal and cantonal authorities, as well as the referendum of 8 July 1956 on the loans that were necessary. Following the death of Eugen Steinemann, Jakob Ragaz (1903-1985) took over as manager of the Social Archives in 1966.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by Miroslav Tucek in 1968. It was during the latter’s time that the Social Archives were recognised by the Swiss Confederation in the framework of the Universities Promotion Act (1974), and moved to their present location in the Sonnenhof at Stadelhoferstrasse 12 (1984). Under Miroslav Tucek’s leadership, the Social Archives underwent considerable expansion and developed into an institution with a nationwide and international reach.\r\nIn 1988, the first female director, Anita Ulrich, was appointed to the Swiss Social Archives. Under her leadership, the Social Archives made the move into the age of new information technologies, which are opening up new opportunities for disseminating the collection that has been constantly expanded in quantitative terms and with regard to the subjects covered. It was also during her time in office that the Swiss Social Archives started a systematic collection of audio-visual sources and a research fund was set up; this was made possible by a gift from sociologist Ellen Rifkin Hill who died in 1999. When Anita Ulrich retired in 2014, Christian Koller was appointed as the new director.\r\n\r\n[Read more...](extension://elhekieabhbkpmcefcoobjddigjcaadp/https://www.sozialarchiv.ch/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/100_Jahre_Sozialarchiv_2006.pdf)","mandates":"The Swiss Social Archives are the first port of call in Switzerland for all those looking into social change, the social question and social movements.

The Archive of the Helvetic Republic becomes Switzerland’s first central archive. It changes location on a number of occasions, as it is always situated at the headquarters of the Helvetic Republic. The core of the archive consists of treaties and other diplomatic documents. During the Mediation Period (1803–1813), the Restoration (1814–1830) and the Regeneration (1830–1848) it grows steadily. Its home is in Bern city hall. With the foundation of the Federal State, the “Federal Archive” becomes part of the Federal Chancellery. In 1849 Johann Jakob Meyer, Secretary of the Federal Chancellery, becomes the first “federal archivist”.\r\n\r\nThe first detailed regulations on the Federal Archive come into force on 14 September 1864 and apply to documents from 1798 to 1848 as well as “the new Federal Archive” from 6 November 1848. Overall supervision is entrusted to the Federal Department of Home Affairs, and the Archive is headed by an archivist. Archive records are divided into 13 main sections, with each relating to an area of activity, such as “Justice” or “Telegraphy”.\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the Federal Archive is in what today is the western section of the Swiss Parliament building. The archivist from 1868 onwards is Jakob Kaiser, who joined as a temporary assistant in 1860. His biggest problem is lack of space. Having visited archives abroad, he launches a successful campaign for the Archive to have its own building. The Federal Assembly grants a loan of 67,000 Swiss francs for the purchase of land in the Kirchenfeld district, where little construction has taken place at the time, and for the construction of the building that today houses the Federal Archives.\r\n\r\nThe new building – initially shared with the National Library – allows the Archive and its staff, which has now grown to four, to establish “exemplary order”, as a sub-committee of the National Council notes with approval. It is needed, because the tasks of the Archive are growing: at the beginning of the 20th century, its main activity is publishing editions of files. In 1914, it receives its first typewriter. The official name “Federal Archives” (“Bundesarchiv”) is bestowed in the same year.\r\n\r\nAfter the First World War, at the behest of the Control Committee of the Council of States, the Federal Archives step up their research into foreign affairs and build up their academic contacts within Switzerland. Research assistant Léon Kern lectures at the University of Lausanne. From 1925, now as a junior archivist, he also serves as Professor of Medieval History at the University of Bern. In 1934, having been promoted to federal archivist, he becomes a member of the council of the General Society of Historical Researchers of Switzerland (AGGS).\r\n\r\nThe 1930s see an increase in the number of visitors to the reading room and written enquiries. The “sport of doctorates”, which Jakob Kaiser bemoaned as early as 1904, appears to be growing year by year. It is obvious that clear guidelines on the use of the Archives are needed. On 9 May 1944, the Federal Council approves the “Regulations on the Communication and Lending of Files of the Federal Archives”. These stipulate that files which “date from at least 50 years ago” are accessible to the public “in general and without restriction”. The number of employees continues to grow after the Second World War in response to rising visitor numbers and new responsibilities. The Federal Archives acquire their first microfilm reader in 1963 and their first copier in 1965.\r\n\r\nIncreased interest in the Federal Archives manifests itself in the 1960s in the discussion on a proposal put forward by National Councillor Olivier Reverdin. Entitled “Opening up the Federal Archives to academic research”, it criticises the impossibility of conducting an independent investigation into Swiss neutrality in the two world wars because of long closure periods. The complaint finds a receptive audience. Although the new regulations of 15 July 1966 retain the 50-year closure period, for the first time they provide for exceptions to be made in the case of academic research. Seven years later the closure periods are shortened again, to 35 years.\r\n\r\nThe research activity made possible by these changes is fundamental to the understanding of contemporary Swiss history. During the 1990s, as Switzerland’s role during the Second World War is undergoing a reappraisal, it also creates a new kind of Federal Archives: an institution that, through exhibitions, debates and publications, engages increasingly with the public. At the same time the Federal Archives lend their support to the Federal Act on Archiving of 26 June 1998. This shortens the closure period to 30 years and abolishes preferential access to documents for the academic research community.\r\n\r\nAt the dawn of the new millennium, the Federal Archives face a new challenge: as they are increasingly called upon to archive digital documents, new concepts and different skills for archivists are required. The shift from paper to digital shapes the modernisation of all the Federal Archives’ services. It also opens up a whole range of new ways for society to make use of archived information.","mandates":"The Swiss Federal Archives preserve the documentation of government actions and make it accessible. This enables the administration to account for its activities and work more efficiently. For the public and researchers alike, archiving is essential for the formation of independent, critical opinions in a democratic state under the rule of law. Research in the Federal Archives can be carried out online or on site.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Archives’ mandate is to ensure the long-term availability of information relating to the Swiss Confederation. Their activities cover five areas:\r\n\r\n1. Information management: The Federal Archives support and advise the Confederation on the creation, organisation and management of its data and documents.\r\n2. Appraising archive worthiness: The Federal Archives work with the administrative bodies to select the data and documents that are to be archived for an unlimited period.\r\n3. Preservation and management: The Federal Archives ensure that documents are preserved in the archives and that digital data remain readable at all times.\r\n4. Access: The Federal Archives make a catalogue of the archival and data fonds of the Confederation available to the public. Analogue archive documents can be consulted on site or ordered online as digital copies. Digital archive documents are supplied online.\r\n5. Mediation: The Federal Archives participate in research on selected historical issues and make the results accessible to a broad public.\r\n\r\nThe basis for the Federal Archives’ mandate is to be found in a number of laws – principally the Federal Act on Archiving (ArchA, SR 152.1). The Federal Archives set out their main areas of activity in a strategy, which is valid for five years.","administrativeStructure":"[Read more...](https://www.bar.admin.ch/bar/en/home/about-us/the-federal-archives/organisation.html)","conditions":"Any individual may cite the Federal Act on Freedom of Information in the Administration (Freedom of Information Act, FoIA) and demand access to official documents without having to provide evidence of a particular interest.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient to submit an official application to the authority that issued or received the required document.

The intention was to collect and display material as a record of everyone’s experiences during that war - civilian and military - and to commemorate the sacrifices of all sections of society.\r\n\r\nThe interest taken by the Dominion governments led to the renaming of the National War Museum to Imperial War Museum later in 1917. It was formally established by Act of Parliament in 1920 and a governing Board of Trustees appointed.\r\n\r\nThe museum was opened in the Crystal Palace by King George V on 9 June 1920. From 1924 to 1935 it was housed in two galleries adjoining the former Imperial Institute, South Kensington. On 7 July 1936, the Duke of York, shortly to become King George VI, reopened the museum in its present home on Lambeth Road, South London, formerly the central portion of Bethlem Royal Hospital, or ‘Bedlam’.\r\n\r\nWith the onset of war in 1939 IWM’s remit was extended to include the Second World War. While a programme of collecting got underway, vulnerable collections were evacuated to stores outside London, and the museum was closed to the public from September 1940 to November 1946. Most of the exhibits survived the war, but a Short Seaplane which had flown at the Battle of Jutland was shattered when a German bomb fell on the Naval Gallery on 31 January 1941. This was just one of more than 40 incendiary hits on the building throughout the war.\r\n\r\nThe Korean War led to a further redefinition of the IWM’s terms of reference to include all conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces had been involved since 1914. IWM has therefore continued to collect every type of evidence documenting its very broad remit. Its collections are vast and rich, and in addition to its role as a museum, IWM is also a major national art gallery, a national archive of written and audio-visual recourse, and a centre for research.\r\n\r\nThe distinct Department of Documents was created in the early 1970s with the purpose of acquiring and preserving an extensive collection of British and Commonwealth private papers. The Department also acts as an official place of deposit for large holdings of foreign documents of mainly German origin. This archival material is available for study by members of the public, and is regularly used in books, newspaper articles and television and radio broadcasts concerning the personal experience of warfare since 1914.","generalContext":"The Department of Documents holds an extensive and important collection of primary source material relating to warfare in the twentieth century, largely composed of British private papers and captured German records. The Department’s holdings in relation to film include the papers of Lord Bernstein, the Film Adviser to the Ministry of Information during the Second World War, which consist of official correspondence and reports containing much detail on the production and distribution of films made under their aegis, and the public reaction to them. Also held are a small number of film and television scripts, a few collections of papers of individuals who served with the Film Units of the armed forces, and within the holdings occasional references can also be found in personal diaries and letters to film-going since 1914.","records":"IWM’s collections cover all aspects of twentieth and twenty-first century conflict involving Britain, the Commonwealth and other former empire countries. Created to record the toil and sacrifice of every individual affected by war, the collections include a wide range of material, from film and oral history to works of art, large objects, and personal letters and diaries.IWM is a national repository and is accredited under the Museums Libraries and Archives Accreditation scheme.","buildings":"During the 1970s and 1980s IWM underwent a period of unprecedented expansion, with the establishment of three new branches – IWM Duxford in 1976, HMS Belfast in 1978 and Churchill War Rooms in 1984.

In particular, the ICRC has the right to visit prisoners of war and civilian internees. The Conventions also give the ICRC a broad right of initiative.\r\n- In non-international armed conflicts, the ICRC enjoys a right of humanitarian initiative recognized by the international community and enshrined in Article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions.\r\n- In the event of internal disturbances and tensions, and in any other situation that warrants humanitarian action, the ICRC also enjoys a right of initiative, which is recognized in the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.

From the 14th century onwards, however, the community of citizens and burghers of Geneva began to develop its autonomy by obtaining rights and privileges. This implied the development of a communal authority and the appearance of titles, legal documents proving rights, in other words, the appearance of archives. From the middle of the 15th century onwards, archives, repositories and research tools were available in Geneva.\r\n\r\nOver time, as this community became more and more important, and then sovereign with the departure of the bishop at the beginning of the 16th century, the archives became increasingly important. Although the question of their management periodically comes up in the deliberations of the authorities, in practice it remains very summary. Unlike in other European states, there was no archivist or registrar responsible for their management. Until the end of the seventeenth century, each office kept its archives separately. In the eighteenth century, although still dispersed, efforts to reorganise them improved the situation.\r\n\r\nThroughout this period, the archives and the inventories that describe them were created according to the needs of the administration. They serve above all to prove the titles and rights of the community. Their availability to historians is extremely limited, as archives are above all a place of state secrecy. It was not until the Restoration that the archives were gradually opened to the public. It must be said that the change of regime, a new Europe, a territory redrawn by the Congress of Vienna, the treaties of Paris and Turin as well as the entry of Geneva into the Confederation rendered a large part of the documents obsolete. The archives, which until then had been scattered in various places, were brought together and placed under the responsibility of a \"guardian\" in 1815. However, classification of the archives did not begin until 1839 with the appointment of the first archivist, Louis Sordet. Within the archives, history then took its place alongside legal and administrative functions. The public at the time was the generation of historians who founded the Société d'histoire et d'archéologie de Genève.","records":"The Geneva State Archives preserve archival collections of private origin - that is, all archival documents produced or received by individuals, families, associations, companies, political parties, trade unions, etc., and by any other private institution or non-public body.","holdings":"Since 1986, the [holdings](https://ge.ch/archives/effectuer-recherches/etat-general-fonds) have been inventoried in a computer database available online, called [Adhemar](https://ge.ch/archives/effectuer-recherches/base-de-donnees).\r\n\r\nYou will find there: descriptive notes of the fonds classified after 1986, some digitised fonds, such as the Council registers or the civil status registers (a camera symbol at the top right of the description gives access to the images) and digitised copies of the old inventories on paper.","openingTimes":"The main reading room and the library are located at the AEG headquarters, 1 rue de l'Hôtel-de-Ville.

The need to create the \"Vaudois Archives\" to secure and preserve these important documents, testifying to the administrative functioning and history of the canton, soon became apparent. \r\n\r\nThe first place chosen to house the archives is emblematic: between 1798 and 1955, the Cantonal Archives were housed in the belfry of Lausanne Cathedral. This period was marked by a number of important milestones, such as the drafting of the first regulations for the Vaud Cantonal Archives in 1826, the creation of the first post of State Archivist in 1837 and the opening of the first reading room to the public in 1919. \r\n\r\nAs the number of documents in storage continued to grow, the Archives moved in 1955 to the rue du Maupas in Lausanne (now the site of the Archives of the City of Lausanne). \r\n\r\nAs early as 1890, a building specifically dedicated to the archives was requested, but it was not until 1971 that the cantonal authorities reserved a plot of land in the commune of Chavannes-près-Renens for this purpose. Located in a place called \"La Mouline\", which takes its name from the nearby mill, it is a stone's throw from the Dorigny university site, which was then under construction.

Between 2006 and 2014, nearly 1,200 veterans were visited in 78 cities across 11 countries,  over 1,500 hours of video testimonies were recorded, and more than 11,700 ephemera artifacts digitized, including photographs, documents, letters, and diary pages.  \r\nToday, the Archive’s Veteran Testimonies & Ephemera project is the largest collection of materials dealing with the experience of Jewish soldiers in the Soviet armed forces during World War II.\r\nThe collections continue to grow and evolve.

From its inception, YIVO was deeply concerned that the language and culture of East European Jewry were undergoing radical change in a rapidly modernizing world. YIVO's founders were tireless in collecting the documents and archival records of Jewish communities across Eastern Europe, years before anyone could have predicted the devastation that would befall them. In 1940, YIVO moved its permanent headquarters to New York City, becoming the only pre-Holocaust institution to transfer its mission to the United States from Europe.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, several of YIVO's leading scholars managed to escape from Nazi-occupied Europe and continue their work in the United States. After the war, through the efforts of survivors, the United States Army and others, a significant part of YIVO's collections were reclaimed and brought to the New York headquarters.\r\n\r\nToday the YIVO Library holds over 385,000 books and periodicals in twelve major languages. This includes the unique Vilna Collection of 40,000 volumes with 25,000 rabbinical works from as early as the 16th century. The Library holdings are particularly strong in documentation of Jewish history, culture, and religion in Eastern Europe; the Holocaust period; the experience of immigration to the United States; anti-Semitism; and the continuing influence of Ashkenazic Jewish culture today.\r\n\r\nThe YIVO Archives holds over 24 million documents, photographs, recordings, posters, films, videotapes, and items of ephemera. These include the world's largest collection of East European Jewish sound recordings; over 200,000 photographs; 400+ videos and films; and 50,000 posters documenting Jewish life from the 1900s to the present. YIVO also has thousands of handwritten eyewitness accounts by Holocaust survivors and displaced persons; community records and documents from the Warsaw, Lodz and Vilna ghettos; over 750 memorial books from Jewish communities in Poland and neighboring countries; records of early immigrant relief and rescue organizations; autobiographies of hundreds of American Jewish immigrants; the Bund Archives and Library that traces the Jewish Labor Movement from its inception in Vilna in 1897; and the world's most extensive Yiddish music and theater collection.   \r\n\r\nYIVO offers public lectures, continuing education classes, Yiddish language instruction, publications, research fellowships, and graduate seminars through the Max Weinreich Center for Advanced Jewish Studies. YIVO is in the forefront of preserving Yiddish language and literature, and in advancing scholarship in the fields of East European Jewish Studies and the American Jewish immigrant experience.\r\n\r\nEach year, more than 4,000 scholars, students, museum curators, writers, filmmakers, artists, performers, historians, and family history researchers visit the YIVO Library and Archives, the world's largest collection of Yiddish books, documents, and other artifacts related to the history of East European Jewry.\r\n\r\nYIVO also offers a variety of scholarly publications, conferences, cultural programs, lectures, exhibitions, and courses.","mandates":"Mission: To preserve, study, share, and perpetuate knowledge of the history and culture of East European Jewry worldwide.","records":"YIVO actively collects print and non-print materials, printed and electronic books, documents, photographs, manuscripts, sound recordings, films, artifacts, art works, and other materials relating to all aspects of Jewish history and culture around the world.

Boder](https://voices.library.iit.edu/index.php/david_boder), a psychology professor from Chicago's Illinois Institute of Technology, traveled to Europe to record the stories of Holocaust survivors in their own words.\r\nOver a period of three months, he visited refugee camps in France, Switzerland, Italy, and Germany, carrying a wire recorder and 200 spools of steel wire, upon which he was able to record over 90 hours of first-hand testimony. These recordings represent the earliest known oral histories of the Holocaust, which are available through this online archive.\r\n\r\nDespite the groundbreaking nature of his work, Dr. David P. Boder was largely unsuccessful in his efforts to publish the displaced persons (DPs) interviews. Before his death in 1961 though, he did submit a set of seventy interview transcripts to a select number of libraries and historical foundations across the U.S. (including Illinois Institute of Technology), though few volumes remain today. IIT's Paul V. Galvin Library began the process of digitizing the text and audio of the interviews in 1998.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, copies of the wire recordings were located at the Library of Congress (the location of the originals is unknown). These were converted to Digital Audio Tape (DAT) by the Library of Congress at IIT's request. However, the quality of much of the audio material proved to be disappointing—excessive amounts of static, distortion, hum, and other surface noise make the voices difficult to understand, and in some cases, completely unintelligible. Due to budget constraints, the library was unable to afford the costly audio restoration work necessary to improve the quality of the recordings, and was only able to convert sixteen of the interviews into a streaming format suitable for presentation over the Web.\r\n\r\nThe first Voices of the Holocaust website was launched in 2000. It featured English transcripts for the seventy interviews transcribed by Boder, and streaming audio for a small portion of these. While limited by today's standards, the site offered unprecedented access to the interview material. Previously, to read these transcripts in person or to listen to the recordings first-hand would require an incredible amount of time and effort on the part of any researcher, and would be completely impossible for most members of the public.\r\n\r\nBy the mid 2000s, the project determined that the site (which had remained relatively unchanged since its launch) needed a major upgrade to effectively meet the ever-changing educational needs and research habits of today's students. This decision came at a time when the need for quality information resources regarding the Holocaust was greater than ever. In August 2005, the Illinois legislature signed House Bill 312 into law, expanding Holocaust and genocide education requirements for Illinois elementary and high school students. Conversely, in December 2005, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became the first head of state to publicly question the existence of the Holocaust. These events underscored the importance of the Boder interviews as a primary source for Holocaust education, and provided further impetus to renew project activities. The means to pursue this major overhaul were obtained through a combination of grants, donations, and university funding.\r\n\r\nThe first step in these renewed efforts was to convert the DAT tapes into digital audio files, and to have all of the recordings digitally remastered to improve intelligibility and remove noise and other artifacts caused by the decay of the wire medium over time. This allowed the project to undertake an exhaustive inventory of the recorded material, which led to the exciting discovery of interviews for which no record existed in the known collections of Boder's notes and papers or in the Library of Congress's catalog of the Boder wires. The second step was then to create transcriptions and English translations for almost fifty interviews that were never transcribed by Boder during his lifetime, as well as original-language transcriptions of the seventy that Boder translated into English.\r\n\r\nFinally, a new web interface for the project was developed, with features that allow for more meaningful interaction with the text and audio content. The redesign process has been undertaken using established standards and best practices that will allow for both secure worldwide online dissemination and preservation of the material for future generations.\r\n\r\nFuture Directions\r\nWhen David Boder died in 1961, the important work he began in July of 1946 remained unfinished, with many interviews not transcribed or translated, and his only book of published interviews long since out of print. As of late 2009, all of Boder's 1946 interviews have finally been transcribed and/or translated, and the texts and recordings are fully available to the public. It is our hope that the interactive and dynamic features of the redesigned site bring Boder's efforts to life in a way never before possible, increasing the visibility and impact of the interviews, promoting deeper scholarship and analysis, and ultimately providing a richer understanding of the Holocaust and those who experienced it.","mandates":"The mission of Voices of the Holocaust project is to provide a permanent digital archive of digitized, restored, transcribed, and translated interviews with Holocaust survivors conducted by Dr. David P. Boder in 1946, so that they can be experienced by a global audience of students, researchers, historians, and the general public.","records":"Dr. Boder interviewed displaced persons in France, Switzerland, Italy, and Germany. The interviewees represented all economic levels, many religions, and various nationalities and language groups from across Europe. His usual approach was to point out that most Americans had a limited knowledge of Nazi atrocities, and that by telling his or her story, the interviewee could contribute to both the education of the American public and the historical record. Boder would often begin by asking the person's name, age, and where they were when the war started, then allowed them to speak at will, without the constraints of preplanned interview questions.\r\n\r\nBoder returned to Chicago and with the help of grants from the National Institute of Mental Health transcribed and translated seventy of the interviews into English from 1947-1957. In 1949, edited versions of eight of the interviews were published in I Did Not Interview the Dead (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1949). Boder eventually published all seventy of his translations in a set of self-published volumes, under the title Topical Autobiographies of Displaced People Recorded Verbatim in Displaced Persons Camps, With a Psychological and Anthropological Analysis. Boder sent copies of these volumes to dozens of libraries before his death in 1961, though fewer than thirty sets survive today.","buildings":"The John Crerar Library moved to the University of Chicago in 1985, prompting the renaming and renovation of the building.

As a University of distinction, the campus has demonstrated its dignity and character because of the respect it has accorded the tapes and the people who made them.\r\n\r\nThis archive represents a gurantee of honest presentation--unembroidered, without dramatization, a scholarly yet austerely moving collection of information and insight. We have been and are engaged in rescuing fragments of fragments of memory. We have done that quietly, without fanfare, but with integrity and quality. Because of that, the project is what it is, does not need any hype or dramatization. It speaks for itself--literally.\r\n\r\nThose who have had access to the tapes--including scholars, psychologists, historians, and more than 1,000 students--have found themselves riveted to their tape recorders or VCRs.

Although Fry came to France with lists of only 200 names, he was approached by thousands of refugees to help them evade the Gestapo. At that time, the Gestapo could ask the Vichy government to ``surrender on demand'' any non-French person, who would then frequently face deportation to concentration camps.\r\n\r\nIn a period of thirteen months, Varian Fry managed, mainly through illegal means and always facing possible arrest, to save or help thousands of refugees. Among these were famous persons, such as the painters Marc Chagall, Max Ernst, Andre Masson, and Wilfred Lam; the sculptor Jaques Lipchitz; the writers Franz Werfel and Hans Habe; the harpsichordist Wanda Landowska; Spain's leading Catholic philosopher Alfredo Mendizabel; Hannah Arendt, political scientist; Fritz Kahn, medical authority; Jaques Hadamard, called the ``Einstein of France''; and Otto Meyerhof, Nobel-Prize winning biochemist. Unfortunately, there were many famous persons who could not be saved.\r\n\r\nOn account of his activities, Fry was pursued by the Vichy authorities and was arrested and detained. Soon thereafter, American consular representatives refused to renew his passport. In September 1941, he was expelled from France and forced to return to the United States. In 1945, he published a book about his experiences (Surrender on Demand). He passed away in 1967 without ever receiving any recognition for his work from his own government.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 he was awarded the \"Certificate of Honor\" and the \"Righteous among Nations\" medal in the presence of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who declared on that occasion: \"We owe Varian Fry our deepest gratitude, but we also owe him a promise - a promise never to forget the horrors that he struggled against so heroically, a promise to do whatever is necessary to ensure that such horrors never happen again.\"","mandates":"The purpose of the Varian Fry Foundation Project/IRC is to make the Varian Fry story more widely known in this country, particularly among high-school and college students.","administrativeStructure":"The Varian Foundation Project/IRC is affiliated with the Association Varian Fry - France which was founded in Marseilles in October 1999.\r\n\r\nThe College Initiative of the Project is directed by Professor Justus Rosenberg of Bard College, New York.

The foundation trained 2,300 interviewer candidates in 24 countries, hired 1,000 videographers, and recruited more than 100 regional coordinators and staff in 34 countries to organize the interviewing process in their respective regions. Between 1994 and 2000, interviews with Holocaust survivors and witnesses took place in 56 countries and were conducted in 32 languages.\r\n\r\nThe interviewing methodology was developed in consultation with Holocaust historians, psychologists, and experts in the field of oral history. The life history format of the interview meant interviewees discussed their lives before, during, and after the Holocaust. The organization’s trainings, interviewer guidelines, and videographer guidelines ensured that the interviews would be conducted with a consistent approach.\r\n\r\nIn the foundation’s offices on the backlot of Universal Studios, staff pioneered innovations to address the challenges of how to ingest, preserve, and catalog the massive number of hours of video being recorded on Betacam SP tapes. The organization holds 11 patents on the digital collection management technologies it developed. The Visual History Archive now contains more than 115,000 hours of testimony – the equivalent of a dozen years. Due to the patented indexing and search engine, users can pinpoint moments of interest down to the minute.\r\n\r\nIn January of 1999, the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation recorded its 50,000th testimony. As collection of new testimonies slowed down compared to the massive collection efforts before, work on cataloging the collection intensified, and the organization focused even more deeply on developing global partnerships to achieve its goals of preserving and providing access to the archive, building and supporting educational programs, and developing educational products based on the testimonies.\r\n\r\nIn January of 2006, the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation became a part of the Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences at the University of Southern California. It was renamed the USC Shoah Foundation – The Institute for Visual History and Education. When the organization joined USC, there were nearly 52,000 testimonies in its archive. Further technological innovations ensured the ongoing preservation and increased access to the testimonies.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, the USC Shoah Foundation began partnering with other organizations to expand the Visual History Archive to include other genocides and mass atrocities, including the genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, the Cambodian genocide, the Armenian genocide, the Nanjing Massacre, the Guatemalan genocide, and testimonies related to the South Sudan Civil War, the Central African Republic, anti-Rohingya mass violence, and experiences of contemporary antisemitism.\r\n\r\nToday, the Visual History Archive continues to grow in two ways: through the collection of new testimonies, often with local partners, and through partnership with other institutions who deposit their testimonies in the Visual History Archive.\r\n\r\nToday the Visual History Archive contains almost 55,000 testimonies, collected in 65 countries and 43 languages.","mandates":"The USC Shoah Foundation Center for Advanced Genocide Research distinguishes itself from other Holocaust and Genocide centers and institutes by focusing its research efforts on the interdisciplinary study of currently under-researched areas. The Center views Holocaust and Genocide Studies as inherently interdisciplinary. It aims to transcend the differentiated disciplines to bring innovative understanding as well as a global approach.","records":"Locating the Holocaust survivors and witnesses who would become interviewees for the USC Shoah Foundation’s original collection required perseverance, sensitivity, and, most of all, the courage of those willing to share their stories. Outreach methods varied by country and included both far-reaching media campaigns and grassroots efforts, such as circulating an outreach flier that was translated into 20 languages, along with other forms of local outreach. Word of mouth quickly spread in survivor communities, motivating many survivors and witnesses to come forward to tell their stories.\r\n\r\nInterviewers were recruited internationally, drawn from a wide array of backgrounds, communicating in scores of languages and united by the mission to document the stories of the survivors and witnesses before their memories were lost to history. The volunteer interviewers came from across all walks of life – journalists, educators, members of the community, academics, survivors, children of survivors, and others – and did not need to be experts in the Holocaust to contribute their time and energy. Each interviewer participated in training by USC Shoah Foundation, which ultimately trained 2,300 interviewer candidates in 24 countries. Training sessions included history, interviewing methodology, and practical exercises.\r\n\r\nDuring its formative years, the USC Shoah Foundation devised an interviewing methodology in consultation with Holocaust historians, psychologists, and experts in the field of oral history. The USC Shoah Foundation still follows this methodology today in its collection of new interviews. The partners who deposit their interviews in the archive follow their own interviewing methodologies. (You can read more about them in the Our Partners pages.) The interviewing process is comprised of four stages: pre-interview, research and preparation, interview, and the after-the-interview stage. Each one of these stages contains specific elements and guidelines.\r\n\r\nPrior to an interview, an interviewer will arrange an in-person meeting with the interviewee to fill out the Pre-Interview Questionnaire (PIQ). This face-to-face conversation is a way to for the interviewer to begin building rapport, describing the purpose and general shape of the interview, and answering questions. The PIQ is designed to gather the interviewee’s biographical information, including birthplace, family background and names, and the broad strokes of the interviewee’s life, including wartime experiences and postwar life right up to the time of the meeting. The information gathered from the PIQ is the interviewer’s road map to the interviewee’s life story, guiding the interviewer’s research and preparation for the interview, helping to generate specific questions, and providing the basis for the interviewee’s biographical information in the Visual History Archive. In addition to filling out the PIQ during this phase, the interviewee also signs the Release Agreement, which advises the interviewee about future potential uses of the testimony and grants copyright of the interview to the USC Shoah Foundation.\r\n\r\nAfter the pre-interview, the interviewer embarks on research and preparation for the interview. This includes historical research and preparing topical questions. Based on what is learned at the pre-interview, interviewers have time to research countries, cities, camps, ghettos, and other pertinent information. Interviewers generally follow the chronology of the interviewee’s experience, and develop questions around the experiences that are central to the interviewee’s life. Although the interviews are not scripted, interviewers are trained to prepare appropriate questions and topics of conversation in advance of the interview.\r\n\r\nMost interviews are conducted in the interviewee’s home and in his or her language of choice. All USC Shoah Foundation interviewers are trained in the same methodology of conducting oral history interviews. They are instructed to ask open-ended questions and are encouraged to use questions that clarify, probe, and follow up in order to elicit more details. The interviews follow a life history chronology, beginning with the interviewee’s experiences before genocide, then during the genocide, and after the genocide. In some cases, interviews include interviewees performing music, reciting poetry, or displaying their original works of art. In the final sections of the interview, interviewees are invited to share physical mementos or photographs. They then have the opportunity to invite family members to join them.\r\n\r\nAfter the interview takes place, interviewers use the time to thank the interviewee for the interview and to ensure that the Pre-Interview Questionnaire has been properly and fully completed. In order to provide additional support to the interviewee, a list of local psychological resources is offered, should the interviewee wish to talk to a mental health professional about the experience of giving testimony. Interviewers are also instructed to connect with interviewees a few days after the interview. Often, strong bonds and long-lasting friendships develop as a result of the experience shared during the interview process. Upon the completion of every interview, the USC Shoah Foundation provides the interviewee with a copy of his or her testimony.","buildings":"Currently more than 160 institutions around the world have access to the VHA.","holdings":"The Visual History Archive contains over 115,000 hours of testimony, the equivalent of 13 years of material. Safeguarding this material has been a primary aim of the USC Shoah Foundation since its inception.\r\n\r\nBetween 1994 and 1999, the USC Shoah Foundation recorded interviews on 235,005 Betacam SP videotapes. All physical media storage experiences data rot at some point in time. Conservative estimates were that videotapes would have a 20-year shelf life, and digital hard drives would have five years before visual content would show signs of age-related damage. In a rapidly changing technology landscape, the USC Shoah Foundation faced challenges of how to safeguard the testimonies in perpetuity.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, with funding from the USC Office of the Provost and Oracle, the USC Shoah Foundation began a four-year, multimillion-dollar effort to digitally preserve the interviews in its Visual History Archive. Tapes were transferred from the storage facility in the eastern United States and processed to generate copies in a digital format called Motion JPEG 2000, which captures the picture and sound quality of the master recordings. In addition to generating Motion JPEG 2000 duplicates of the testimonies for preservation, the Institute generated other copies in commonly used formats such as MPEG, QuickTime, Flash, and Windows Media Player.\r\n\r\nThese digital files are continuously checked and analyzed for signs of potential damage. A robot continuously loads each cartridge containing the digital files into a reader and analyzes the files for any signs of data damage or disruption. If there are any signs of damage, that piece of storage is trashed. No media is saved for more than three years and every piece of the archive is inspected every six months. Constantly checking and migrating the data ensures its longevity.\r\n\r\nWhen the USC Shoah Foundation discovered that nearly 5,000 testimonies had technical or mechanical issues, such as video dropout or flickering or audio problems, it assembled a restoration team, which developed proprietary software to manage workflow of the massive effort to fix image quality problems. The team developed a technique of breaking down the video into still images, isolating and removing the ‘bad’ images, and replicating very similar ‘good’ images to fill the gaps. In addition, the restoration team repaired physical damage, such as broken tape casings and missing pins, springs, or clips. In some cases, entire tapes must be re-threaded onto new cassettes, or pieces from several cassettes are combined onto one working cassette so that a testimony could be digitally preserved and shared.\r\n\r\nThe USC Shoah Foundation established four mirror sites for the Visual History Archive, guaranteeing that a fully-functional Visual History Archive will exist in perpetuity outside its home at the University of Southern California. Three mirror sites are located in the United States and one site is in Europe. Mirror sites house the Visual History Archive on computer robots similar to the ones that store the original collection at USC. In addition, a high-speed connection to the Visual History Archive computers at USC allows these universities to ingest new testimonies, execute updates, refresh and write tapes, and more – up until now, tasks that could only be performed at USC. Mirror sites ensure that if the original Visual History Archive at USC were damaged or destroyed, an identical archive would still exist elsewhere in the world.","conditions":"On the public internet, desktop computers and mobile devices can search the entire Visual History Archive and view around 4,000 video testimonies.

In order to acquire, study and disseminate knowledge about this tragedy, an international foundation was established to support the creation of the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center. This non-governmental organization is building the first modern Holocaust museum in Eastern Europe, establishing a center for the study of the tragedy, in which large-scale scientific and educational activities will be carried out.\r\n\r\nThe Memorial Center will bring together a museum, research institutes, a library, an archive and an online multimedia platform. First the Center’s focus is the development of online projects dedicated to biographies of victims of the Babyn Yar tragedy, creation of a visual archive, and the comprehensive study of the distant and recent past of this territory. In undertaking these activities, the Memorial Center maintains an open dialogue with Ukrainian society and pays special attention to the public discussion of the tragedy and the formation of a humanistic moral judgment on it.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center will be the Museum, the construction of which will begin in the near future. At the end of 2020, the concept of the future museum was presented. During 2021, the detailed architectural concept design was developed. The opening of the museum was planned in 2025/26.\r\n\r\nHowever, in connection with the Russian military aggression against Ukraine, BYHMC postponed all offline projects, including the construction of memorial objects in Babyn Yar. The focus is now on online initiatives related to preventing and combating all forms of genocide, protecting human and civil rights and preserving the memory of the victims of Russian-Ukrainian war. \r\n\r\nOn 25 October, 2022 during a meeting with the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the Members of BYHMC Supervisory Board, the Head of State noted, that it is extremely important now to pay even more attention to the protection of historical memory and informing about the conclusions humanity has drawn from the large-scale tragedies of the 20th century. That is why the project of BYHMC has to be implemented after the end of the war in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of the war the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center has been actively working in the 3 following areas: humanitarian aid to the Holocaust survivors, righteous and Ukrainian people, war projects and Holocaust projects.\r\n\r\nConcerning the humanitarian aid and social assistance, BYHMC created a coordination team to help the Righteous and the Holocaust survivors. 40 people have been evacuated to safe places and more than 80 families receive support. Furthermore BYHMC purchased medicines for 1400 people, provided 540 people with medical assistance, delivered 16000 food sets in 87 localities (within the Susidy program) and redirected part of the BYHMC funding for purchasing 7 armored ambulances. The Viсtor Pinchuk Foundation, with the support of BYHMC, provided 8 front-line medical institutions with transport incubators with ventilators. BYHMC also purchased protective membranes to preserve cultural monuments in Kyiv and cooperated with the Department of Cultural Heritage Protection.","generalContext":"BYHMC now continues to develop partnership agreements in different areas of cooperation. Already developed are: a Partnership Memorandum with the State Archives Service of Ukraine regarding archives digitalization, a Memorandum of Understanding and Cooperation with the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine, a cooperation agreement with Yad Vashem within the project Names, a cooperation agreement with the Federal Archives of Germany (Bundesarchiv), a Partnership Memorandum with the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine regarding informing about the Holocaust in Ukraine and Europe and a cooperation agreement with Yahad - In Unum concerning the investigation of Russian war crimes in Ukraine.","mandates":"The funding of the Memorial Center is carried out on the principles of equal participation of Ukrainian and international donors. As of 2020, the organization has 6 donors: 3 citizens of Ukraine, 2 citizens with citizenship of the Russian Federation and Israel, 1 U.S. citizen. For 2021, it is planned to attract funds from a wide range of international donors on the basis of fundraising.\r\n\r\nIn June 2020, the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center was included in the Transparency Register (Transparency Register) of the European Union. The Register cooperates with the European Parliament and the European Commission. The inclusion of the Memorial Center in this register means that the organization’s interests are visible, its budgeting is transparent and that citizens and interest groups are provided with an opportunity to track its activities.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is meant to offer the EU-based point of contact/donation to such donors etc. in addition to BYHMC.","administrativeStructure":"The Board consists of prominent public figures, philanthropists, politicians and cultural figures. It oversees the work of the Foundation and the Memorial Center and advises the Board of Directors in their discussions and key decisions.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of Russian invasion to Ukraine the following members have left the Supervisory Board: Mykhailo Fridman, Herman Khan, Iryna Bokova. In May 2022, Leonid Kravchuk has passed away.\r\n\r\nThe Public Council is an advisory board created to facilitate broader discussion of Memorial Center activities and to maintain an ongoing dialogue between the Foundation and Ukrainian society. The Public Council includes well-known representatives of Ukrainian civil society who share the Foundation’s mission and goals. Its main purpose is to honor the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and the tragedy of Babyn Yar.\r\n\r\nThe Academic Council aims to develop a research strategy for the Memorial Center and monitor the compliance of the Center's activities with the principles of scientific rigor and reliability.\r\n\r\nFoundation Babyn Yar (Foundation) was created in support of BYHMC operating in Kyiv, Ukraine.\r\n\r\nNext up is the goal to preserve the Memorial Center and the team, enlist support of the state (partnership projects, media communications, events), strengthen the Supervisory Board with the representatives of state and public institutions and strengthen the Donors' Council that will allow the BYHMC to continue implementing the project.","records":"Materials about the tragedy, the history of the place, the current state of Babyn Yar and the attitude of society towards crimes against humanity are being collected, processed and will be presented to the public in the Museum. The purpose of the museum collection is to serve the needs of exhibition, research, and educational work. The main goal is to create the largest collection of materials and artifacts related to the Holocaust tragedy in Ukraine and Eastern Europe. These are all originals that convey historical truth. The goal of the collection is not just to demonstrate these tragic events, but also to serve as a visual testimony and proof to fight Holocaust denial. The work of the Memorial Center is based on strict scientific knowledge. Historical materials undergo independent review and are approved by the Scientific Council which consists of 3 prominent experts from different countries. The principles of working with the past are enshrined in a document entitled [\"The Historical Narrative\"](https://babynyar.org/storage/main/e0/ce/e0ced2fd93bcb8a9abbdeb5df828416f12fdac9eaf096d2766b54c989e86e48b.pdf) which is available to all.\r\n\r\nThe collection is clustered around several major themes. In general, all personal belongings of those who died, survived, fought for memory, or those who stood aside as —all the exhibits tell a story or share an experience; it is these exhibits that constitute the basis of the museum's collection. \r\n\r\nThe Library of the Memorial Center will be the largest collection of textual testimonials about the Holocaust in Eastern Europe, and will serve as an international research center. It will offer digital and physical access to all the modern research databases and media archives available at Babyn Yar and our partner organizations. The library will also display a unique compilation of hundreds of personal libraries that belonged to prominent scientists, cultural figures, dissidents, and also ordinary people of that time, so that visitors can see what books people of that period read.\r\n\r\nThe Library searches, stores and provides open access to materials about Babyn Yar and other crimes against humanity committed during the Second World War on the territory of Ukraine and throughout Eastern Europe. Another major theme for material and document collection is the ruined pre-war world of Jewish life and culture in multinational and multifaith Ukraine and Kyiv.","buildings":"In dialogue with the Foundation, the Architecture Advisory Board has established a set of architectural principles that should inform and guide the development of the museum to come.   \r\n\r\n- the building should not disturb the ground;  \r\n- natural elements present on site itself should be used as primary building materials;  \r\n- a monumental, historical form should lead to an immersive experience;\r\n- visitors should be able to explore the museum as they want and create a personal narrative.   \r\n\r\nWith these principles, BYHMC has engaged architects from all over the world in dialogue to inquire what it might mean to implement them on site. Architects Jan de Vylder and Inge Vinck proposed to strategically dismantle an abandoned and unfinished building on site—the psychiatric hospital extension—brick-by-brick, and use them for the construction of the new museum. Architect Philippe Rahm noted the abundance of life that has grown on the site since the massacre of 1941 and proposed to intensify this process through the use of greenhouses to create Gardens of Eden.  Landscape architect Gunther Vogt proposed to use soil from the site and, perhaps mixing it with earth from Jerusalem, create new bricks to be used in walkways or structures, reviving the history of the brick factory that caused the 1961 mudslide. Watson Salembier proposed to re-sacralize the site, firstly by bringing the ancient streams of Babyn Yar back up to the surface.\r\n\r\nThe purpose is not only to plan a museum, research center, and site intervention, but also to intervene and view the site itself as a museum or center. In other words, a whole environment with stations, in which you can organize paths, trails, walks and discoveries. The holistic approach to the design of the building, the exposition and the site will be developed in dialogue with representatives of the different fields of knowledge, arts and different social groups. Environmentally friendly materials will be used in the construction; the basic principle is to take a sensitive approach to the natural and urban environment. \r\n\r\nAll construction projects are frozen as long as the war continues. There are still two important projects for museum spaces in Babyn Yar - The Mound of Memory and The Jewish Cemetery office house, which have to be implemented after the end of the war.","holdings":"The archive is an open storage structure where linked data tools are used, and digitization is not selective, but covers the whole set of documents. The goal is to collect the largest database of Holocaust related documents and to expand this to other Eastern European countries.\r\n\r\nThe digital library contains only reliable sources of information. Available in the library are more than 4 000 paper books, of which more than a hundred are rare and old, about 250 digital and electronic editions, 8 000 photographs from different times, including hundreds previously unseen, video evidence, drawings, audio recordings, databases of full-text scientific publications and much more.

In 1989 Rabbi Joshua Stampfer z”l led a community conversation on the need for a museum focused on Jewish cultural life. The community members that gathered for that conversation became the founding board of the Oregon Jewish Museum (OJM). The museum operated as a “museum without walls”, opening with the Jews of Greece at Multnomah County Library’s Central Library. Over the next decade the museum brought exhibitions of Jewish interest to Portland, hosted at a variety of area venues. A 1995 merger with the inactive Jewish Historical Society of Oregon resulted in OJM taking stewardship of the archival materials, artifacts, photographs, and oral history interviews the organization had collected beginning in 1973. Although the Oregon Historical Society generously provided workspace to house and accession the collection, that merger prompted the museum to refocus its mission and to find appropriate space in which to properly care for and exhibit that collection. \r\n\r\nIn 1999 the museum moved into its public first space at Montgomery Park, with modest room for exhibitions and collections storage. The inaugural exhibition, Jews Germany Memory, photographs by Edward Serotta, drew 300 people on opening night. As the need for a more permanent space became urgent, in 2000 OJM relocated to a storefront in Old Town, where it launched its first large scale, curated exhibition. A Call to Serve: Oregon Jews in the Armed Services opened on Veterans Day, 2001 two months after the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. This was the first time that the museum made a call to the community to come forward with their objects, photographs, and stories of military service. The exhibit was a huge success and did much to increase both the visibility of the museum in the community and the credibility of the museum’s project. It was a model that has been taken forward from that time, always resulting in new research and often in growth for the collection. \r\n\r\nIn late 2009, as membership and community attendance continued to grow, OJM moved to a much larger building in NW Portland, offering expanded exhibition space and enabling the staff to develop public programing and a small gift shop. Public lectures and films complemented exhibitions as diverse as Transport, featuring the work of Henk Pander and Esther Podemski, Project Mah Jong, Sukkah PDX, That’s All Folks, the story of Mel Blanc, and Auto/Biography: Portraits of People With Cars. \r\n\r\nIn 2014 OJM merged with the Oregon Holocaust Resource Center, which was founded in 1984, taking on an expanded mission as the Oregon Jewish Museum and Center for Holocaust Education (OJMCHE). This merger enriched the museum in countless ways: the education staff now includes a full-time Holocaust educator; as stewards of the Oregon Holocaust Memorial in Portland’s Washington Park we bring thousands of school children to both the Memorial and to the Museum; and we continue to be the only community repository for the Jewish experience in Oregon. The merger fundamentally strengthened the museum’s core mission by deepening the focus on Jewish values and traditions. OJMCHE believes the Holocaust provides one of the most effective subjects for examining basic moral concerns. It simultaneously addresses universal issues of intolerance and the dangers of denying diversity. For many young Oregonians, an OJMCHE program has been their first encounter with the history of the Holocaust. ","generalContext":"The Oregon Jewish Museum and Center for Holocaust Education explores the legacy of the Jewish experience in Oregon, teaches the enduring and universal relevance of the Holocaust, and provides opportunities for intercultural conversations.","records":"The OJMCHE document collection represents families, clubs, synagogues, businesses, and philanthropic organizations. It is the largest collection of the documented and visual history of the Jewish people of Oregon. The document collection encompasses a broad range of formats including books, journals, manuscripts, papers and records, maps, and ephemera. It includes materials dating from the mid 1800s to the present day.\r\n\r\nOJMCHE has an outstanding and extensive photograph collection dating from the 1860s through today. These images visually document Jewish experience in Oregon. The ongoing digitization and cataloging of photographs is central to OJMCHE’s mission to make these images available to researchers. \r\n\r\nOJMCHE holds the largest collection of Jewish artifacts in the Pacific Northwest. The collection documents Jewish life in Oregon through both everyday and ceremonial objects. With the exception of our impressive Berger Collection of Ceremonial Judaica, all the artifacts were created by or for the Oregon Jewish community. One recent focus of our collecting has been the Jewish Business Collection, with items from nearly 200 businesses throughout the state. Another growing collection highlights items from Oregon synagogues.\r\n\r\nOJMCHE’s holdings include painting and sculpture, decorative arts, photography, works on paper, and artist books, as well as graphic arts and mixed media. While the collection focuses on Oregon Jewish artists, the scope also includes Jewish artists from around the world.","buildings":"In 2016 the OJMCHE Board purchased the building at 724 NW Davis Street, on the North Park Blocks in downtown Portland, doubling the museum’s size.

Other holdings originated with the Aguilar Free Library, a small public library system operated by a group of philanthropic Jews in the nineteenth century that merged with NYPL The New York Public Library in 1905. \r\n\r\nBy the early 1900s, the Dorot Jewish Division already rivaled the oldest and best Jewish libraries in Europe. Abraham S. Freidus, Judaica cataloger of the Astor Library, was appointed the Division's first chief and presided over its rapid initial growth. The Division continued to grow by purchases, gifts of books, and contributions, such as a 1983 endowment from the estate of New York City realtor Jacob Perlow to support acquisitions, conservation, and public services. In 1986, the Dorot Foundation endowed the position of the Chief of the Division, and in 1987, the  S. H. and Helen R. Scheuer Family Foundation made a substantial gift for renovation and new technology. Essential donations from the Nash Family Foundation were instrumental in expanding the Jewish Division's Special Collection. \r\n\r\nAn expanded history can be read [here](https://www.nypl.org/blog/2022/11/14/celebrating-125-years-dorot-jewish-division).","records":"The type of collection development at the Jewish Division was different from other major Judaica libraries which tended to absorb many private libraries of prominent scholars or organizations. The Jewish Division inherited or acquired only a few relatively small collections, but continued its steady and cumulative development through purchases and donations—book by book, lot by lot.\r\n\r\nSome precious Hebrew books and manuscripts were inherited by the Jewish Division from the Lenox Library in New York, which in the second half of the 20th century was famous for its collection of Bibles assembled by its founder James Lenox (1800–1880), a prominent American bibliophile and philanthropist. \r\n\r\nA personal library of the prominent Russian Jewish Hebraist, lexicographer, educator, community leader, and writer Leon Mandelstamm (1809–1889) arrived at the Library in 1897. It consisted of 2,135 books in Hebrew, German and Russian that were bought from the merchant and bibliophile Abraham M. Bank (1854–1904). Bank had earlier purchased the collection directly from Leon Mandelstamm in St. Petersburg and later immigrated and settled in New York. \r\n\r\nThe collection of 500 books, from the personal library of Meyer Lehren (1793–1861), a member of a wealthy Jewish family in Amsterdam, mainly rabbinical responsa, was bought at auction and added in 1899.\r\n\r\nIn 1903, the Aguilar Library became a part of the Circulation Department of NYPL and its many Yiddish books and periodicals joined the holdings of the Jewish Division. This move formed the core of the Yiddish holdings of the contemporary collection. ","buildings":"On May 23, 1911, the Beaux-Arts–style main branch of the Library on Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street opened its doors to the public. For the first time, the Jewish Division acquired its own reading room on the second floor. The astounding magnitude and grace of the building became an additional attraction for readers. Most patrons were foreign-born, assimilated scholars from Eastern and Central Europe and many were Russian speakers who also visited the Slavonic Division located next door. Later, in the 1930s and 40s, the Jewish Room became a meeting point for refugee scholars fleeing Nazi Germany. An environment of \"intellectual hospitality\" reigned in the reading room. Abraham Freidus estimated that in the 1910s to the early 1920s, 30 to 40 readers visited the Jewish Division daily—amounting to nearly 10,000 visitors per year. He proudly stated that this was much more than the number of visitors at the British Museum, the Bodleian Library at Oxford, and the Asiatic Museum in St. Petersburg.","holdings":"The collection includes precious rarities that date back to the 13th century and currently amounts to over 250,000 titles of books and periodicals, incunabula, unique archival materials and gorgeous medieval manuscripts, theater and music scores, posters, photographs, ephemera, as well as oral histories in all the Jewish languages.

He set out to create a structure that would be in harmony with other great Washington landmarks—the White House, Capitol, Treasury Building, and Lincoln Memorial—and at the same time express the significance, safety, and permanence of the records to be deposited inside.\r\n\r\nGround was broken in 1931; President Herbert Hoover laid the cornerstone in 1933; and the staff moved in to work in 1935. The building reached capacity in the late 1960s, and many records were moved to off-site storage and regional archives. After years of planning, in 1993 a new archives building was completed.","generalContext":"Archives locations in 15 states and the District of Columbia, from coast-to-coast, protect and provide public access to millions of records. In addition to assisting Federal agencies and the public with research and reference services, we deliver educational programs and public workshops to help Americans learn how to use archived records.

By now, they add up to a formidable number, diverse in form as well as in content. There are approximately 13.28 billion pages of textual records; 10 million maps, charts, and architectural and engineering drawings; 44.4 million still photographs, digital images, filmstrips, and graphics; 40 million aerial photographs; 563,000 reels of motion picture film; 992,000 video and sound recordings; and 1,323 terabytes of electronic data. All of these materials are preserved because they are important to the workings of Government, have long-term research worth, or provide information of value to citizens.\r\n\r\nIn addition, NARA must also manage the rapidly growing number of electronic Government records. Now being developed, the Electronic Records Archives (ERA) is our strategic response to the challenge of preserving, managing, and providing access to electronic records.

A Joint Congressional Committee—the first joint committee—would furnish oversight. In 1802, President Thomas Jefferson approved a legislative compromise that made the job of Librarian of Congress a presidential appointment, giving the Library of Congress a unique relationship with the American Presidency. Jefferson named the first two Librarians of Congress, each of whom also served as the clerk of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nIt was also former President Jefferson, retired to Monticello, who came to the new Library’s rescue during the War of 1812. In 1814, the British burned Washington, destroying the Capitol and the small congressional library in its north wing. Congress accepted Jefferson’s offer to sell his comprehensive personal library of 6,487 books to “recommence” its own library. Jefferson’s concept of universality is the rationale for the comprehensive collecting policies of today’s Library of Congress.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Jefferson’s belief in the power of knowledge and the direct link between knowledge and democracy has shaped the Library’s philosophy of sharing its rich, often unique collections and services, as widely as possible.\r\n\r\nFrom today’s perspective, it is obvious that the Library plays important legislative, national, and international roles. However, it was not clear during the Library’s early decades in the U.S. Capitol that it would evolve into more than a legislative institution, a role favored by the Joint Library Committee. Moreover, it was plagued by fire, space shortages, understaffing and the lack of an annual appropriation. Although it made popular literature available to the general public, the Library’s primary purpose was to serve Congress.\r\n\r\nThe situation changed dramatically after the Civil War as the country settled down, the economy expanded, and both the federal government and the city of Washington grew rapidly.\r\n\r\nAinsworth Rand Spofford (Librarian of Congress 1864-1897) took full advantage of an emerging cultural nationalism to persuade the Congress to view its Library as a national institution and therefore the national library.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of Jefferson, Spofford successfully advocated a single, comprehensive collection of American publications for use by both Congress and the American people. The centralization of U.S. copyright registration and deposit at the Library of Congress in 1870 was essential for the annual growth of these collections.\r\n\r\nSpofford’s greatest challenge was to persuade Congress to construct a much-needed separate Library building. The process began with an architectural competition in 1873 and consumed his interest and activities until the massive building opened to Congressional and public acclaim in 1897. The impressive new structure in Italian Renaissance style, the largest library in the world when it opened in 1897, was a monument to American achievement and ambition. It was named for Thomas Jefferson in 1980.\r\n\r\nThe 20th century would see that magnificent building welcome increased staff, diverse multimedia collections and a steady stream of new patrons. Most of this progress was shaped by Herbert Putnam, who was appointed Librarian of Congress in 1899, as the country entered the Progressive Era.\r\n\r\nAn experienced librarian, Putnam came to the post with a comprehensive plan for the Library of Congress as a national library. President Theodore Roosevelt agreed with Putnam’s basic premise, which the Librarian summarized in a 1901 speech to the American Library Association: the new “National Library” should “reach out” to support other libraries throughout the nation. In the early 1900s, the president agreed with Putnam’s steadily increasing requests for additional funds, and so did Congress. Moreover, in 1903 Roosevelt issued an executive order that transferred the records of the Continental Congress and the personal papers of six of the founding fathers to the Library to be “preserved and made more accessible.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1914, Putnam established the Legislative Reference Service (LRS) as a separate Library department. This effort was supported by Wisconsin Sen. Robert M. LaFollette Sr., who felt that Congress thus had “taken an important step in rendering the business of lawmaking more exact, economically sound and scientific.”\r\n\r\nWith President Roosevelt’s endorsement, a vote of confidence through an increased annual budget from Congress and the space provided by an attractive new annex building (today known as the John Adams Building), Putnam pursued his plan with what others described as “energetic nationalism.” The result, between 1901 and 1928, was a series of new national library services, research publications, and catalogs, cultural functions and new offices.\r\n\r\nThe Library’s symbolic role as a repository and promoter of the democratic tradition was of special appeal to Putnam’s successor, Archibald MacLeish, who served as Librarian of Congress during most of World War II. MacLeish relished the Library’s role as the custodian of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution and helped plan the shipment of the documents, along with other treasures, to Fort Knox, Kentucky, and additional sites for safekeeping during the war.\r\n\r\nHaving weathered two world wars, expanded its collections and constructed a second building, the Library of Congress approached the 1960s on firm footing. Challenges lay ahead, however, for a new global era of growth was underway. In response, the Library gradually took on a new international role. Hallmarks of the period were a continuation of post-World War II interest in international affairs (especially in relations with Soviet Union, Africa and Asia), accelerated technological change in all walks of life, and increased funding for libraries and research materials in the United States and abroad. A new national concern for civil rights was prompted in part by racial violence and the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of automation into the Library’s cataloging procedures and the initial development of the Library’s overseas acquisitions and cataloging programs contributed strongly to the institution’s unprecedented rate of growth between 1954 and 1975. In those 21 years presided over by Librarian of Congress L. Quincy Mumford, the Library’s book collection increased from 10 to 17 million volumes, the staff from 1,600 to 4,500 and the annual appropriation from $9.5 million to $116 million. In collaboration with Congress and the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, in 1958 the Library initiated planning for a third major building on Capitol Hill.\r\n\r\nLibrarian Mumford was well aware of the need to “balance” the legislative and national responsibilities of the Library, both which grew dramatically during his tenure. In 1962, in response to critics who suggested that the needs of the nation’s research libraries might be better served if the Library of Congress was moved from the legislative to the executive branch of government, he strongly defended the institution’s legislative branch location. He also asserted that “the Library of Congress today performs more national library functions than any other national library in the world.”\r\n\r\nHistorian Daniel J. Boorstin was appointed Librarian of Congress in 1975 by President Gerald R. Ford. Greater public visibility for the institution was one of his primary objectives. Several of the offices he created, including the American Folklife Center, the Center for the Book and the Council of Scholars, were public-private partnerships assisted by advisory boards and private funding. In 1980, he presided over the opening of the James Madison Memorial Building. In 1984 he obtained a major appropriation for the multi-year restoration and modernization of the Jefferson and Adams Buildings.\r\n\r\nKey activities expanding the Library's functions at all levels benefited from the leadership of Librarian of Congress James H. Billington in the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century. These included the development of a National Digital Library, the John W. Kluge Center for Scholars, and the opening of the National Audio-Visual Center on the Library's new Packard Campus in Culpeper, Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, President Barack Obama nominated librarian Carla Hayden, chief executive officer of the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore, Maryland, to be the 14th Librarian of Congress. The first woman and African-American to serve as Librarian, she inherited a unique, global institution, widely known for its free, non-partisan service to Congress, librarians, scholars, and the public—in the United States and around the world.","mandates":"For nearly two centuries, the Library of Congress has relied first on its own expert staff, as well as on copyright depositors, book dealers, scholars, and other experts to assure that the national collections of the United States continue to enable the Library of Congress to fulfill its mission to \"sustain and preserve a universal collection of knowledge and creativity for future generations.\"","records":"Containing approximately 164 million items in virtually all formats, languages, and subjects, these collections are the single most comprehensive accumulation of human expression ever assembled.

Materials come to the Library through an acquisitions program that extends throughout the world and includes over fifteen thousand agreements with foreign governments and research institutions for the exchange of research materials; gifts; purchases; transfers from other U.S. government agencies; and copyright deposits. Each day about twenty-two thousand items arrive at the Library. Approximately ten thousand of these items will become part of the permanent collections, selected in accordance with the Library of Congress Collections Policy Statements which provide a plan for developing the collections and maintaining their existing strengths.","buildings":"Because of the extraordinary size and diversity of the Library's collections, there is no one place for researchers to access them.

Kennedy wrote the Archivist of the United States to ask him to consult with White House staff and representatives of Harvard University concerning establishment of a Presidential library in Cambridge, Massachusetts. President Kennedy announced then that he would follow precedents set by Presidents Hoover, Roosevelt, Truman and Eisenhower, and give his papers and memorabilia to the National Archives for a Presidential Library.\r\n\r\nA month before his death, President Kennedy visited Cambridge, Massachusetts, and chose a site next to Harvard University for the Library. It was to be the place where the records of his Presidency could be kept and where he would have his office when he retired from public life.\r\n\r\nPlans for the Kennedy Library began to take shape in December 1963, when members of President Kennedy's family met with several of his closest associates to discuss a suitable memorial. While many suggestions were offered by people in all parts of the country, Mrs. Kennedy and the other members of President Kennedy's family decided that the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum should be the only official national memorial to the President.\r\n\r\nThey also agreed that the project should have three parts: a Museum, an Archive, and an educational Institute that would carry forward President Kennedy's interest in bridging the gap between the academic world and the world of public affairs.\r\n\r\nThe John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library, Inc.—a private, non-profit corporation—was chartered in Massachusetts on December 5, 1963, to construct and equip a library in Massachusetts to house and preserve the papers and historical materials of John F. Kennedy and his associates, and to transfer title of these to the United States as elements of a Presidential archival depository.\r\n\r\nAmong the Corporation's many responsibilities were the raising and management of all building funds, the selection of the Library site, the appointment of the architect and exhibit designers, the selection of the general contractor, and the actual supervision of all construction.\r\n\r\nThe Kennedy Library Corporation, under the leadership of Stephen E. Smith, raised more than $20.8 million for both the construction of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, and for the creation and endowment of an Institute at Harvard for the study of politics and public affairs.\r\n\r\nIn 1966, the Kennedy Library Corporation presented Harvard University with an $8 million endowment for the creation of the Institute of Politics. A living memorial to President John F. Kennedy, the Institute was created to complement the work of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum by helping to inspire the ideals of democracy and freedom in young people all over the world. Harvard University's Institute of Politics seeks to unite students, particularly undergraduates, with academics, politicians, activists, and policymakers on a non-partisan basis and to stimulate and nurture their interest in public service and leadership. The Institute also strives to promote greater understanding and cooperation between the academic world and the world of politics and public affairs.\r\n\r\nThe General Services Administration established the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in temporary quarters in the Federal Archives and Records Center in Waltham, Massachusetts on October 1, 1969, and at that time announced the opening of the first portions of the Presidential papers for research use.\r\n\r\nIn 1975, the Kennedy Library Corporation abandoned plans to build the library on the site at Harvard University originally selected by President Kennedy due to prolonged delays in freeing the site for construction and opposition by some Cambridge residents who feared urban congestion caused by visitors and tourists.\r\n\r\nThe Library Corporation selected a new site for the library adjacent to the Harbor Campus of the University of Massachusetts Boston at Columbia Point in Dorchester. The 9.5 acre, waterfront site with panoramic views of Boston's skyline and Harbor Islands was donated to the Kennedy Library Corporation by the University of Massachusetts Boston with the consent of the state legislature.\r\n\r\nGround breaking for the dramatic Kennedy Library building designed by I. M. Pei took place on June 12, 1977. The building was completed and dedicated in October 1979.","mandates":"The Kennedy Library Corporation transferred title of the completed library to the United States National Archives and Records Administration on October 20, 1979 at a dedication ceremony attended by President Jimmy Carter.\r\n\r\nIn 1984, the work of the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library Corporation was reorganized and incorporated under Massachusetts law as the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.\r\n\r\nThe John F. Kennedy Library Foundation and the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum continue to be a model of a public/private partnership. While the Kennedy Library and Museum receives an annual federal appropriation for building maintenance and a portion of its personnel costs, the appropriation from Congress provides less than half of the Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum's annual budget. The balance is provided by fees generated by admission to the Museum, the Museum Store, and the use of the Library's meeting facilities; and through the generosity of thousands of private individuals, corporations and foundations who donate money and in-kind services to the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.\r\n\r\nThe strong financial support and creative resources provided by the Kennedy Library Foundation enable the Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum to further advance the study and understanding of President Kennedy's life and career and the times in which he lived, and to promote a greater appreciation of America's political and cultural heritage, the process of governing and the importance of public service.","records":"The Library acquires, preserves, arranges, describes, and provides access to primary-source materials in all formats that document the life, career, and times of John F.

(JWV) is the longest running veterans service organization out there.  JWV was founded in 1896 by a group of 63 Jewish veterans from the Civil War after a series of anti-Semitic comments about the lack of Jewish service in the Civil War.  Since then, JWV has been working hard to be the voice of American Jewry in the veteran community.\r\n\r\nHowever, JWV has been up to much more than fighting against anti-Semitism since 1896.  In World War I, JWV was essential to establishing the Jewish chaplaincy within the military.  JWV also fought to include other grave markers in veterans’ cemeteries, such as the Star of David.  During the rise of the Third Reich, JWV led a huge protest march and boycott of Nazi Germany and their goods.  JWV campaigned hard for the 1938 Foreign Agents Registration Act, which eventually led to Nazi leaders in America being deported from the United States.\r\n\r\nIn World War II, JWV fought hard for the Jewish soldier, airman, sailor and marine.  Jewish services were conducted on the battlefield in part due to the JWV SOS program, where Jewish communities were able to send packages to the American troops.  When the troops came home, JVW was there for them.  JVW campaigned to have religious and racial protections put into the 1944 GI Bill, which ended up allowing Jewish and other minority soldiers to use their GI benefits to lift themselves out of poverty.\r\n\r\nDuring the Cold War years, JWV fought the Ku Klux Klan, the John Birch Society and fought hard for the rights of Jewish American soldiers during McCarthyism, when Jewish American troops were being accused or let go because of their Eastern European upbringing.  JWV also spearheaded the National Conference on Soviet Jewry in the 1960s that eventually led to thousands of Soviet Jews being freed from the Eastern Bloc.\r\n\r\nIn 1955, JWV established the National Museum of American Jewish Military History as a living testimony to Jewish American military service going all the way back to Asser Levy in the American colony of New Amsterdam.  Since then, thousands have gone through the museum to learn more about the rich Jewish history and what major sacrifices Jewish Americans have made in the name of American democratic values.\r\n\r\nDuring the Vietnam War, JWV worked hard once again to create care packages for the Jewish soldiers overseas and also campaigned vigorously for the return of all prisoners of war (POWS) from this conflict.\r\n\r\nDuring the post-Vietnam era, JWV led a national protest after it was announced that the United States would close the Haifa USO.  The decision was reversed in 1989, and the USO was kept open with the help of donations from JWV until its final closing in 2002.\r\n\r\nAfter the attacks on September 11th, JWV sprang into action yet again to continue to serve the Jewish American military community.  They sent packages and served as lay leaders once again in the Jewish military community.  JWV was also there when Jewish service members came home.  Hundreds of JWV members attended funerals of fallen Jewish soldiers during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nJWV fought hard for its members who did not receive awards because of anti-Semitism.  In 2002, the Leonard Kravitz Jewish War Veterans Act was passed thanks to the efforts of JWV, which resulted in 24 service members being awarded the Medal of Honor, who were initially passed over because of discrimination.\r\n\r\nIn the 2010s, JWV fought once again for the Medals of Honor for Tibor Rubin and for William Shemin.  JWV also became involved in the national debate on sexual assault in the military, and campaigned for the Deborah Sampson Act, which guarantees the right for care to any female veteran.\r\n\r\nWhen Israeli Minister Tzipi Hotovely said that American Jews “never send their children to fight…serving as soldiers, going to the Marines, going to Afghanistan, or to Iraq,” JWV fought to correct this injustice that ultimately ended in an apology from Minister Hotovely. In addition, JWV continues to work with the Israeli government on ways to educate the Israeli public about Jewish American military service from the Revolutionary War to today’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.","mandates":"The JWV affirms that Jewish men and women serve honorably and heroically in the military forces of the United States of America during peacetime and war.

It is part of a network of more than 150 Federations across North America. Originally, Federations around the country were developed to aid Jewish immigrants in need of social services. Today, their role has changed slightly but the Jewish Federation of St. Louis is stronger than ever.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, the Jewish Federation of St. Louis began an effort to focus on greater engagement as a community development organization. It recognized that before individuals will be interested in supporting their work, they have to be engaged. By working on engagement first, the federation moves from a model focused primarily on fundraising, to one that also inspires individuals to join together in its mission – where Jewish community is part of a life well lived.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Jewish Federation of St. Louis is still a powerful engine for propelling the community’s dollars, decisively, effectively and efficiently. Each year, the Jewish Federation of St. Louis works with its volunteer and professional community leadership to assess the needs of its community and establish strategic plans to sustain our vibrant Jewish ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThrough its partnerships with thousands of donors, the Jewish Federation of St. Louis then raises over $15 million each year to meet those needs.\r\nIts volunteers then lead a community investment process to get those funds working to fulfill its mission through agencies, congregations, organizations, and programs.\r\nThe Jewish Federation of St. Louis team then evaluates those investments based on the impact they are having in St. Louis, in Israel and wherever there is a need.\r\nThis community impact and philanthropy work has been done since its inception in 1901 and remains the core of the work of the Jewish Federation of St. Louis.","mandates":"Funds are received through the Jewish Federation of St. Louis’ Annual Campaign, the Jewish community’s largest fundraising effort. The dollars raised support high-quality agencies, programs and services that sustain our community’s vision of a thriving, vibrant and engaged Jewish community.

Professor Nora Levin z”l and Josey Fisher, impacted by video testimony of survivors in Yale University’s Department of Psychiatry, committed themselves to documenting unique accounts of Holocaust experience in the Philadelphia area. At the time, individual narratives were not yet recognized by established historians as integral to Holocaust documentation. With no funding and no established model, the Holocaust Oral History Archive project began.\r\nConcerns over rising Holocaust denial prompted many previously reticent survivors to go on record - Gratz College was a familiar and trusted community resource. Trained volunteers visited their homes, tape recorders in hand. Supportive interviewers at familiar kitchen tables encouraged survivors to share painful, complex memories. For some of them it was the only time they would do this; for others, it encouraged them to continue to speak. They began to find their narrative, a way to tell their stories. For scholars and educators, these testimonies became an essential part of Holocaust documentation, personalizing and humanizing the experience so that the historical context breathes with reality.\r\n \r\nThe Holocaust Oral History Archive volunteers included survivors who interviewed, aided with translations and place names, and enriched our collection with their personal accounts – a Polish teen hiding in Warsaw, a young German woman passing as a non-Jew, a young French-Russian teen liberated from Auschwitz, a Czech teen rescued in Denmark and Sweden, several young evacuees on the Kindertransport, two children on the SS St. Louis, and a teen on the HMT Dunera. A liberator of the Ohrdruf concentration camp developed a special collection of witnesses to the liberation.\r\nThe outreach expanded in 1985 when the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors was held at the Civic Center in Philadelphia. The Archive recruited hundreds of additional volunteers and held a day-long training session in the sanctuary of Rodeph Shalom Synagogue in Center City. Organizers used curtains to provide private interview space within the main hall, and copies of these audiotapes were later sent to the interviewees. It became clear that some had not yet told details of their experience to their families and these tapes provided a transition to more open communication.\r\nTwo additional gatherings in 1991 and 1998, dubbed “Rickshaw Reunions”, were held in local hotels. Individuals who had found safety in Shanghai were interviewed in their rooms, sitting on beds and desk chairs, taking time from eager reunions with other “Shanghailanders”.","generalContext":"The Holocaust Oral History Archive of Gratz College seeks to record, preserve, and make available to advanced students and researchers the testimonies of those who experienced the Nazi era (1933-1945) in ghettos, camps, labor brigades, resistance forces, national armies, in hiding, and in rescue operations. Established in 1979 and maintained by a dedicated volunteer staff, the Gratz collection is one of the earliest Holocaust oral history projects in the U.S. and includes over 850 audiotaped interviews, most of which are transcribed, catalogued and available through interlibrary loan.

During this period, the Constitution was accepted, as well as additional legislation to regulate life in the newly independent nation and preserve national heritage. Thus, the Central National Archives were established in Kaunas, the capital of Lithuania at that time. In 1921, a peace treaty was signed between Soviet Russia and Lithuania facilitating the return to Kaunas of many documents that had been taken to Russia during the Czarist regime.\r\n\r\nDuring the second period under the Nazi rule, the archive continued its activities, albeit under certain restrictions. It was subject to Reichskommissariat Ostland, and was only open to visitors of German origin. In fact, the ongoing responsibility for the archives was under the control of the Office for Internal Affairs, which was located in Kaunas.\r\n\r\nThe third period, when the archives were under the Soviet regime, was actually divided in two. In 1940, following the invasion by the Soviet Union, the Archives administration was transferred to Vilnius. From an organisational point of view, the archives were now under the supervision of the NKVD. Confidential documents were transferred to the Soviet Union and afterwards were only partially returned. After the Second World War, the archives came once again under the supervision of the NKVD; in 1960, the responsibility for the archives was transferred to the National Council of Soviet Union Archives.\r\n\r\nThe current period began with the enactment of the Archives Law. The name of the main archives was changed to the Lithuanian Central State Archives, and the archives were transferred to the supervision of the Central Archives administration which is subject to the Lithuanian Council of Ministers.","generalContext":"The Archives deal with archival documentation created between 1918 and 1990, as well as documents, films, photographs and recordings that are a part of the Lithuanian cultural data base.","mandates":"The activities of the Archives have been arranged in accordance with the Lithuanian Constitution, European Union legislation, and additional laws that regulate the activities of the Archives as a public government office.\r\n","buildings":"The Lithuanian Central State Archives have two main reading rooms: one where researchers can consult written documents and another where they can consult video and audio documentation. \r\n\r\nThe address of the document reading room is:\r\n\r\nO.

The Polish displaced persons first redesigned the cemetery of honor erected by US army in May 1945 in the village of Flossenbürg. They established an initiative to erect a memorial on the site. In 1947, a memorial chapel and a commemorative landscape near the former crematorium were inaugurated. The chapel and grounds were one of the first concentration camp memorials in Europe. In 1948, the memorial committee succeeded in having the site placed under the protection of the state of Bavaria. The actual camp grounds were not a part of the memorial conception, but became part of the infrastructure for the economic postwar development of the village of Flossenbürg. The former concentration camp quarry has been reactivated – till today. The grounds’ area of the roll call square and its surroundings was used as an industrial estate. In the late 1950s, in big parts of the camp grounds a settlement was erected to house German expellees’ families who had been working there and living in former camp’s buildings for ten years. At the same time a cemetery was erected to honor the victims of the death marches, but the historical circumstances surrounding their violent death were silenced. This state of affairs remained substantially unchanged for several decades. In 1964 the detention barrack, a place of torture and executions, nearly completely was demolished by authorities. Later a small documentation could be seen there. 1995 a Jewish memorial was erected near the chapel. Beginning with the inception of the institution in the end of 1999 Flossenbürg Concentration Camp Memorial has been transformed from a cemetery to a memorial that does justice to its history as one of the central sites of National Socialist persecution in Europe. Permanent exhibits about camp’s history and the aftermath were opened in 2007 and 2010, the redevelopment of the Memorial grounds was finished in 2015 when an education center and a museum café was opened. In 2016 a permanent exhibit on the two places of subcamp Hersbruck/Happurg was opened.","mandates":"Since its inception on January 1, 2003 the Bavarian Memorial Foundation is responsible for the former concentration camps Dachau and Flossenbürg. The Memorial Foundation Act clearly is stating the main task of the Bavarian Memorial Foundation: \"The purpose of the Foundation is to preserve the monuments as witnesses to the crimes of the National Socialists, as places of remembrance of the suffering of the victims and as places of learning for future generations, to support historical research on this and to contribute that the knowledge of the historical events is kept alive in people's consciousness and carried on.\" (GedStG, Art. 2) The Foundation's mission includes not only the original memorial work but the support of the historical-political education, editing its own publications and the cooperation with institutions working with the same objective in Germany and abroad.","holdings":"The archive of Flossenbürg Concentration Camp Memorial is holding a heterogeneous collection of records, newspapers and newspaper clippings, photographs, maps and plans.

The camp was significantly expanded in the spring of 1941. Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union, over 21,000 Soviet POWs were deported to the camp until the autumn of 1941. Between July 1941 and April 1942, 14,000 Soviet POWs died there of starvation, disease and exposure.\r\n\r\nIn April 1943, the SS took over the southern section of the camp and turned it into an “exchange camp” for Jewish prisoners. The SS decided in the spring of 1944 to also use the camp for other purposes and additional groups of prisoners. This dramatically changed the character of the camp, the structure of the prisoner society and, above all, the prisoners’ living conditions. When the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp was liberated on 15 April 1945, British soldiers found thousands of unburied bodies and tens of thousands of severely ill prisoners.\r\n\r\nA total of 52,000 prisoners from all over Europe were killed in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp or died immediately after its liberation as a result of their imprisonment.\r\n\r\nAfter the liberation, the British Army set up an emergency hospital at the nearby Wehrmacht barracks which developed into a camp for Polish and Jewish displaced persons (DPs).

The new Center celebrated its opening in March 2005, and launched a series of programming exploring emerging scholarship on the American past.\r\n\r\nFrom its founding in 2004, the Lehman Center was directed by Kenneth T.

He was joined by Associate Director Lisa Keller, Professor of History at SUNY-Purchase and scholar of trans-Atlantic US and British, women's, and urban history.\r\n\r\nFrom 2005 to 2019, the Lehman Center hosted a wide range of seminars and lectures featuring emerging scholars and new works on diverse themes in American history.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, from 2005 to 2017, the Center co-sponsored and hosted occasional conferences on themes ranging from urban history to the World War I Centennial to immigration in Europe and the Americas.\r\n\r\nIn 2019-2020, in conjunction with a planned renovation of the Lehman Suite in the International Affairs Building and in anticipation of longtime Director Kenneth Jackson's retirement, the US faculty in the Department of History joined with Columbia University Libraries staff to re-envision the Lehman Center.

Almost three-fourths of the 400 volumes that John Harvard gave to the College in 1638 were theological in nature. Books on religion continued to make up a third to a half of the college’s holdings for the next two centuries. After the Divinity School was established in 1816, duplicates from the College Library were combined with new purchases to form the beginnings of a specialized library for the school. This collection was moved into Divinity Hall upon the latter’s completion in 1826.\r\n\r\nThe collection grew quickly in those early years, due largely to gifts by faculty and alumni (especially Francis Parkman, Convers Francis, Jared Sparks, James Walker, and Thomas Hill) and to the purchase of the library of Prof. G. C. F. Lücke of Göttingen (made possible by a gift from Col. Benjamin Loring). In 1887 the Divinity Library received a home of its own in a new fire-safe building constructed next to Divinity Hall.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 Harvard Divinity School and Andover Theological Seminary formed a partnership and agreed to combine their collections in a common library. Housed in the new Andover Hall, which was built by Andover Seminary on Francis Avenue in 1911, it became the Andover-Harvard Theological Library. When the Harvard-Andover educational partnership was dissolved in 1926, HDS acquired Andover Hall, and Andover Seminary's deposits remained in the library under the terms of a continuing agreement.\r\n\r\nAfter 1926 HDS continued to invest heavily in the library. In 1960 a beautiful new modern facility was constructed, which was expanded significantly in 2001. Renamed the Harvard Divinity School Library in 2021, it functions today as a constituent part of the Harvard Library with its vast network of collections and services. Its staff of highly educated and service-oriented librarians develops and stewards collections and content in a wide variety of formats and provides guidance in the practice of research that makes effective use of those resources.","generalContext":"Harvard Divinity School Library is the primary portal to the vast resources for the study of religion available to researchers at Harvard.

Truman and to make them available to the people in a place suitable for exhibit and research. \r\n\r\nAt present the Library has about 15,000,000 pages of manuscript materials in its custody. Approximately 6,500,000 are the White House files. In addition to its manuscript collections, the Library also has an audiovisual collection consisting of about 128,000 still pictures, 1,300 hours of audio disc and tape recordings, 500 motion pictures and 1,000 hours of video tape recordings. The Library's collection of printed materials includes more than 10,000 books. In adding to the book collection, the Library attempts to purchase any new books on the history of the Truman administration or relating to the career of Harry S. Truman.\r\n\r\nThe Truman Library established an oral history project in 1961 in an effort to fill gaps in the written record. The areas of emphasis have been President Truman's early career, the work of the White House staff during the Truman administration, and United States foreign policy during Truman's presidency. More than 500 transcribed oral history interviews are in the Library’s collection.\r\n\r\nMore than 13,000 researchers have visited the Library's research facilities since 1959. Approximately half of the researchers who come to the Library each year are scholars or graduate students working usually in the fields of history or political science. The other half are college and high school students, writers, film makers, journalists, genealogists, and people who have a personal interest in Truman's life and career. Researchers have come from almost every state in the Union and from more than 40 foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe Harry S. Truman Library Institute, a non-profit corporation, was organized in 1957 to foster and assist in the Library's growth and development as a national center for study and research. Its directors are leaders in government and public affairs, university officials, scholars, and businessmen. The purposes of the Institute are to promote research into the Truman administration through the awarding of grants and the sponsoring of scholarly conferences, to assist in the development of the Library's museum and public programs, and to help the Library in many ways to maintain the integrity of its programs. The Institute does not use government funds but depends on the public for gifts and bequests.","mandates":"The Truman Library is a Presidential library operated by the Federal government. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Library was the first Federally-administered Presidential library. In 1955, Congress passed the Presidential Libraries Act providing that the Federal government could accept the papers of any former President, along with the land, building and equipment required to house and preserve the papers and other historical materials, and make them available to the public. Prior to the passage of the Presidential Records Act of 1978 making Presidential papers public property, Presidents upon leaving office had traditionally regarded White House files as their personal property. The federally-operated Presidential library is designed to act as the depository for a President's White House files and other manuscript and audiovisual materials deposited there by a president or his associates.","records":"The core of the Library's research holdings and the principal reason for its existence is its collection of the papers of Harry S. Truman. These papers consist principally of the White House files for the Truman administration. They also include papers that document Mr. Truman's life and careers as farmer, soldier, businessman, local politician, U.S. Senator, Vice President and former President. Since the Library opened it has engaged in an ambitious acquisitions program. Presently, in addition to the Truman papers, the Library has in its custody more than 450 manuscript collections of individuals who were associated with Mr. Truman at some point during his career in an official or personal capacity. The Library also has a small quantity of Truman-related Federal records among its holdings. The largest segment consists of the records of Presidential commissions and committees appointed by President Truman during his administration.","buildings":"The Library building, which cost $1,750,000, was built by the Harry S. Truman Library Inc., a private corporation, with funds donated by more than 17,000 individuals and organizations from all parts of the country. The building and Mr. Truman's Presidential papers were transferred to the Government at a dedication ceremony held on July 6, 1957, and attended by Government officials of both parties. Chief Justice Earl Warren delivered the principal address.\r\n\r\nThe Library, located in Independence, Missouri, President Truman's hometown, crowns a knoll facing U.S. Highway 24 on land donated by the City of Independence. In 1968 and 1980 additions to the building were completed at a cost of $310,000 and $2,800,000, respectively. The present Library building, which is a one-story full basement structure, is roughly circular in configuration. The total floor space is about 100,000 square feet. The building contains stack areas for the storage of manuscripts, books, and audiovisual materials, a research room, staff offices, an auditorium, conference and seminar rooms and museum exhibit and storage areas. President and Mrs. Truman are buried in the courtyard, as are their only child, Margaret Truman Daniel, and her husband, Clifton Daniel.","openingTimes":"The Research Room is open by appointment \r\n\r\nMonday - Friday, 8:45 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. \r\n\r\nClosed on all Federal Holidays.

Most of the items in the museum collection were given to Mr. Truman while he was President. Among the gifts in the collection are valuable presents from foreign heads of state and more humble presents from American citizens from all walks of life. The exhibits in the Library's museum emphasize the career of Harry S. Truman, and the history of the Truman administration. Among the permanent exhibits are a mural painting in the entrance lobby, \"Independence and the Opening of the West,\" by Missouri artist Thomas Hart Benton; a reproduction of the Oval Office as it was during the Truman administration; and the office which Truman used in his retirement years.\r\n\r\nThough its public programs unit, the Library attempts to reach a diversity of people and organizations by sponsoring conferences and research seminars, by conducting special tours of the Library's museum for school classes and educational groups, and through a wide range of other activities.","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[39.103139,-94.420984]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"us","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/us-005530","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/us-005530/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/us"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2022-11-18T15:48:57.607Z"}},{"id":"us-005535","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Getty Research Institute","parallelFormsOfName":[],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"1200 Getty Center Drive","city":"Los Angeles","region":"California","postalCode":"CA 90049–1679","country":"United States","countryCode":"US","email":["reference@getty.edu"],"telephone":["+1 310-440-7300 (visiting)","+1 310 440-7390 (library)"],"fax":["+1 310-440-7780"],"url":["https://www.getty.edu/research/"]},"history":"The Getty Research Institute is dedicated to furthering knowledge and advancing understanding of the visual arts and their various histories through its expertise, active collecting program, public programs, institutional collaborations, exhibitions, publications, digital services, and residential scholars programs.

Its large manufacturing sector made it a destination of choice for a growing number of Eastern European immigrants whose arrival increased the city’s Jewish population to almost 40,000. Making their home along the Main (Boulevard St. Laurent) they brought with them different languages, political ideologies, and religious practices.  Recognizing the need for their own social institutions, they established a public library to cherish the Yiddish language and culture that lay at the heart of this community. From its beginnings and into the 21st century, the Yidishe-folks-biblyotek, or Jewish Public Library (JPL) has continued to offer a familiar space that nourishes the intellectual, creative, and spiritual needs of the community.\r\n\r\nThe JPL opened its doors on May 1st, 1914 in a modest cold-water flat at 669 rue St. Urbain with a small collection of 500 books. From the beginning the Library was more than mere shelves and texts. It quickly became the meeting place for literary and cultural exchange, maintaining a link to the still flourishing Jewish communities of Eastern Europe while promoting the community’s growth in its new Quebec home. With the creation of the Yidishe folks universitet (YIFO) or the People’s University, the Library also became a centre for continuing education.\r\n\r\nThe Library developed out of the reading rooms of several community organizations including the Poale Zion, Baron de Hirsch Institute, and various synagogues. Yehuda Kaufman and Reuben Brainin, two well-known leaders in the community, led the charge to bring together these organizations into one public Library. These two men were joined by a legion of volunteers and groups devoted to the idea of a space for community members to better themselves through literature and learning. The cooperation of these groups, despite differences in language, politics, and religious beliefs, ensured the success of a library that was for the people and by the people.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the Library’s own building in 1952 on the corner of Mont-Royal and avenue de l’Esplanade, placed it squarely in the heart of the community. The new Library was within metres of the Young Men’s -Young Women’s Hebrew Association, Fletcher’s Field (Parc Jeanne Mance), the Hebrew Old People’s and Sheltering Home, as well as synagogues and other communal organizations. The role of the Library as a cultural centre was reflected in the inclusion of an auditorium, gallery and meeting spaces, a music room, and an art room. By mid-century, the community began to move from the Main to the western suburbs of the city. Following its members, the Library sold its building in 1966 eventually moved to its current location on chemin de la Côte Ste-Catherine.\r\n\r\nOver its hundred year history, the JPL continued to respond to the needs of immigrant groups through its collections, programmes, and services. In the 1960s the JPL welcomed thousands of Jewish immigrants from North Africa with services in French. Later, waves of immigrants from Russia, France, Israel, Ethiopia, and South America were equally welcomed into the JPL.","mandates":"Since 1914, the Archives’ mandate has been to collect, preserve, and make available original documents, photographs and recordings that tell the social, economic, and cultural stories of Montreal’s Jewish community.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Jewish Public Library Archives is generously supported by the Alex Dworkin Foundation for Jewish Archives, the Peter and Ellen Jacobs Virtual Archives Fund of the Jewish Public Library, the Rosalind & Morris Goodman Family Fund, the Azrieli Foundation, and the Sonia & David Oberman Archives Internship Fund.","records":"The Archives is a dynamic collecting body.

Until then, Mr. Kellen had not spoken publicly about his experiences—the result of a promise he and his first wife, Julia Kellen, had made to each other after arriving in the United States. However, a surge of Holocaust denial in the mainstream media during the 1980s convinced Mr. Kellen he could not be silent any more.\r\n\r\nIn 1984, Mr. Kellen borrowed space in a small corner of the Jewish Community Center on El Paso’s West Side. With a few books and a handful of personal items, he began telling his story. Word quickly spread about this Holocaust display and, before long, schools and interested people were making appointments to hear from Mr. Kellen. The space was so small that groups sat closely on the floor just to listen.\r\n\r\nThe community rallied behind Mr. Kellen’s desire to teach the Holocaust. Louis and Miriam Rosenbaum donated $250,000 so that a full-fledged museum could be built. By 1994, that museum, appropriately named the El Paso Holocaust Museum and Study Center, opened its doors next to the Jewish Community Center.\r\n\r\nEPHM thrived in its new location and each year hosted thousands of visitors and hundreds of school tours.  Sadly, an electrical fire in October, 2001, destroyed the original Museum. A devastated Henry Kellen rummaged through the charred remains and wondered if that was the end of his vision. Almost immediately after the fire, the Museum’s Board of Directors vowed to rebuild and work quickly began on a Capital Campaign to raise the money needed for a new Museum.\r\n\r\nThe community came through and $2.5 million was raised for the new Museum. It is worth noting that the majority of the money was raised in El Paso.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Museum did not stop operating. A dedicated staff continued to teach the lessons of the Holocaust—first through visits to schools and organizations and later through a temporary gallery space that was donated to the Museum until the new was completed. The Museum also introduced Education Trunks, complete with classroom sets of books and teaching materials, so that educators could continue to teach the Holocaust to their students.\r\n\r\nSeven years after that electrical fire, the El Paso Holocaust Museum and Study Center reopened its doors to the public in January, 2008, and is part of El Paso’s Museum District Downtown. The Museum features 4,000 square feet of permanent exhibit space and an additional 1,000 square feet of traveling exhibit space.\r\n\r\nEPHM, which celebrated its 30th Anniversary in 2014, was the first Holocaust museum to be established in Texas and is now currently one of only 13 free-standing Holocaust museums in the United States. EPHM is the only fully bilingual Holocaust museum in the United States.\r\n\r\nToday, the Museum continues its mission of educating the public about the Nazi Holocaust so that similar acts will not be repeated. Additionally, the Museum honors the 11 million people who perished in the Holocaust as well as the brave souls who survived.\r\n\r\nEach year, thousands of people visit the Museum. Visitors include students from the region’s many school districts, college students, residents from El Paso and the surrounding regions as well as out-of-town visitors from every corner of the world.","mandates":"The Museum is a nonprofit organization led by a dedicated Board of Directors, a staff of four employees and dozens of dedicated volunteers.
