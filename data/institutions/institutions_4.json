World War I left in its wake the seeds of many additional catastrophes—pogroms, epidemics, famine, revolution, and economic ruin—and JDC played a major role in rebuilding the devastated communities of Eastern Europe and Palestine.\r\n\r\nJDC’s relief activities, emigration aid, and rescue operations were critical following the Nazi rise to power and the outbreak of World War II. After the war, JDC mobilized to support and resettle survivors, help reconstruct the remnant communities of Europe, create a network of social welfare services in the fledgling State of Israel, set up an extensive assistance program for Jews in North Africa and the Muslim world, and provide discreet relief behind the Iron Curtain. With the fall of Communism, JDC established cultural and educational programs to foster a sense of Jewish identify in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union and developed a broad welfare system for needy elderly and holocaust survivors.\r\n\r\nActive today in more than 70 countries, JDC and its partners work to alleviate hunger and hardship, rescue Jews in danger, create lasting connections to Jewish life, and help Israel overcome the social challenges of its most vulnerable citizens, both Jewish and non-Jewish. JDC’s reach extends beyond the global Jewish community by providing non-sectarian disaster relief and long-term development assistance worldwide.\r\n","holdings":"The JDC Archives houses one of the most significant collections in the world for the study of modern Jewish history.

In the ensuing years, the Committee has continued to serve as a channel for Quaker concerns growing out of the basic Quaker belief that «there is that of God in every man» and the basic Quaker faith that the power of love can «take away the occasion for all wars». Though the Religious Society of Friends itself is small, the work of the Committee is supported by thousands of like-minded men and women of many races, creeds, and nationalities, who serve on its staff or make contributions, both financial and spiritual, to its ongoing programs.\r\n\r\nThese programs are varied indeed. Through the years, the Committee has perhaps been best known for its work of relief and rehabilitation for the victims of war. In 1917, at its inception, it sent young men and women to France where they worked in cooperation with British Friends, feeding and caring for refugee children, founding a maternity hospital, repairing and rebuilding homes, and providing returning refugees with the necessities with which to start life once more.\r\n\r\nWith the cessation of hostilities in 1918, the work of the Service Committee spread into other war-ravaged lands: into Russia where workers helped to fight famine and disease, into Poland and Serbia where they established an orphanage and helped in agricultural rehabilitation, into Germany and Austria where they fed hungry children.\r\n\r\nEventually the Quaker service teams completed these tasks and went home, leaving behind them small Quaker centers to supervise the turnover of projects and to give support to the small groups of nationals who had become interested in Quakerism during the time of war relief. Scarcely, however, had the problems of World War I been met than the problems of the 1930’s called forth fresh efforts. Quaker workers were soon engaged in helping refugees escape from Hitler’s Germany; in providing relief for children on both sides of the Spanish Civil War; with feeding refugees in occupied France; and later, in helping victims of the London blitz.\r\n\r\nThe end of World War II brought a burst of AFSC effort, with Quakers engaged in relief and reconstruction in many of the countries of Europe, as well as in India, China, and Japan. In 1947, the Committee helped to resettle refugees who had lost their homes as a result of communal rioting upon the partition of India; and in 1948, Quaker workers undertook a program of relief for Arab refugees on the Gaza Strip. The Korean War, the Hungarian Revolution, the Algerian War all produced fresh openings for Quaker service. In 1966, the AFSC undertook programs of child care and prosthetics with war-injured Vietnam civilian refugees and their children and, shortly after this, extended their aid to civilians in North Vietnam and in the areas held by the National Liberation Front through gifts of medical supplies. During the Nigerian-Biafran War there were Quaker workers on both sides of the battle, and after the cessation of hostilities the Friends stayed on for a program of rehabilitation.\r\n\r\nBut while continuing thus to minister to the victims of man’s inhumanity to man around the world, the AFSC has turned its attention more and more to programs designed to relieve the tensions from which wars come. Since the disparity between rich and poor nations is one cause of such tensions, the Service Committee has concentrated since World War II on the establishment of programs of social and technical assistance in developing nations – among them, Pakistan, India, Zambia, Peru, Mexico, and Algeria. Work in the area of family planning is conducted in Hong Kong, India, and elsewhere, usually in conjunction with other ongoing AFSC projects.\r\n\r\nIn a related effort to get at potential sources of tension, AFSC has sought since the early 1950’s to bring together mid-career diplomats from many nations in informal, off-the-record conferences where they may come to know each other as human beings, free of the armature of office. Beginning in Europe, this program has been extended to Africa and all parts of Asia and expanded to include young leaders and professionals as well as diplomats. In Japan, in India, in Washington, D.C., and at UN headquarters, both in Geneva and New York, Quaker workers seek to bring together men and women who may be in a position to help prevent conflicts between their nations from developing.\r\n\r\nRecognizing that most conflicts have their roots in injustice, the Quaker organization has been long concerned with eliminating such injustice at home. This has led to a long history of involvement with the American Indian, the Mexican-American, the migrant worker, the prisoner, the black, the poor. The AFSC’s approach is to help these people find the tools with which to organize themselves for community action and thus obtain the better schools, better housing, better working conditions they deserve.\r\n\r\nAlso throughout the United States, the AFSC works continually to create an informed public opinion on the issues of war and peace. By means of speaking tours, by publication of peace literature, through a campaign to end the draft, through its own vigils and participation in demonstrations and protests sponsored by others, the Committee works to arouse Americans against the dangers of increasing militarism and to inform them of the status of the military-industrial complex in the United States. In this work, as in many other areas, young people are drawn into the AFSC by their desire to make a positive witness against war and injustice.\r\n\r\n«A good end cannot sanctify evil means; nor must we ever do evil, that good may come of it;» wrote William Penn, the Quaker who founded Pennsylvania in the seventeenth century; «let us then try what love can do.» When the AFSC celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in 1967, «To See What Love Can Do» became its motto.","generalContext":"More than just a collection of records pertaining to one organization’s history, the AFSC Archives provide a unique and singular view of the social, political, and economic movements that shaped the 20th century and are still relevant today.","reproductionServices":"The Library of Congress is making its Web Archives Collection available for educational and research purposes.

It grew during the 1920s and 1930s to be the political, communal, and cultural voice of those Orthodox Jews who were not part of Zionism's Orthodox Jewish Mizrachi party.\r\n\r\nRabbi Eliezer Silver, an Eastern European-trained rabbi, established the first office of Agudath Israel in America during the 1930s, organizing its first conference in 1939. Some of the early rabbinic leaders of the organization included Rabbi Mordechai Shlomo Friedman, Rabbi Shlomo Heiman, Rabbi Leo Jung, Rabbi Herbert Goldstein, Rabbi Joshua Bäume, and Rabbi Joseph B Soloveitchik. After the Holocaust, some prominent rabbis who made their home in America established a moetzes (\"supreme council\") known as the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah, and the movement began to grow rapidly, with the rise of the yeshiva-based and Hasidic Orthodox communities.\r\n\r\nMike Tress led the expansion of the movement during the early 1940s as its chief lay leader, until his death in 1967. His cousin Rabbi Moshe Sherer then took the reins as president, and the organization flourished further in size and accomplishments. After his passing in May 1998, he was succeeded by Rabbi Shmuel Bloom, as Executive Vice President. In 2008, Rabbi Chaim Dovid Zwiebel, having served Agudah as general counsel and director of government affairs, took over as Executive Vice-President. In 2016, his salary was $220,000.\r\n\r\nIn April 2020, Agudath Israel of America head Rabbi Yaakov Perlow, the Novominsker Rebbe, 89 years old, died after contracting COVID-19.","mandates":"Agudah's policies and leadership are directed by its Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah (Council of Torah Sages), composed primarily of rosh yeshivas (the chief spiritual and scholarly authority in a yeshiva) and Hasidic rebbes (who head Hasidic dynasties and organizations).

Rabbi Yaakov Perlow (recently deceased), who was the Novominsker Rebbe and a member of the Moetzes, was appointed as the Rosh Agudat Yisrael (\"Head of Agudath Israel\").\r\n\r\nThe executive staff includes Rabbi Yitzchok Ehrman as COO, Rabbi Chaim Dovid Zwiebel as the Executive Vice President, Rabbi Labish Becker as the Executive Director, and Rabbi A.D.

Additional property was acquired from the Council of Peille and the monks at the Abbaye de Saint Pons and construction actually only began in June 1215 when Fulco de Castello, one of Genoa's most enterprising consuls, anchored his fleet of ships loaded with building supplies in the harbor. By then they were ready to trace the outlines of a rampart of thirty-seven sections and four buttressed towers connected with 8-meter to form a triangular boundary. Later a higher wall was erected and a second fortress was added on the port side entrance, none of which remains today.\r\n\r\nGenoa played an important role in Europe of the 12th century and the Grimaldis were one of the aristocratic families of Genoa. The Genoese were traders throughout the Mid-East and the Orient and bankers who provided foreign sovereigns with funds, ships and armed soldiers. When the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen challenged the authority of Pope Innocent IV, the Genoese divided into two parties: The Guelphs sided with the pope and the Ghibellines with the German Emperor. The Grimaldis belonged to the Guelps who were the defenders of the Pope. Conflicts between the two groups continued into the late 13th, when the Ghibellines won, they ousted the Guelphs—and the Grimaldis—from Genoa.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of January 8, 1297 Francois Grimaldi, nicknamed Malizia, disguised himself as a monk and asked for shelter for the night at the fortress in Monaco. The unwitting guard let him in and was killed and Francois, and with his men captured the fortress for the Grimaldis. The seizure of the fortress enabled Rainier Grimaldi to wage war on Genoa with France, who made him a French Admiral. However, it was Charles I, the son of Rainier, who is considered the first lord of Monaco in 1341. For 30 years the fortress was lost and won back several times. The Grimaldis acquired Menton in 1346 and Roquebrune in 1355 and Charles I installed a loyal garrison and strengthened the existing fortifications by expanding the ramparts and building a breakwater to protect the entrance to the port.\r\n\r\nIn the 15th century, Lambert continued to protect Monaco by building defenses around the 'rock' and installing a 400-man garrison. All this time, improvements were made to the fortress and it was slowly being transformed. The main three-story building, protected by high scalloped walls connecting the towers of Saint Marie, Milieu, and Midi was located on the east side where the Palace stands today. Between the first two towers and the front of the ramparts Lambert built a two-story building, whose rooms opened onto a balcony.\r\n\r\nThe Grimaldis have always fought to keep their land and sovereignty. In order to do so they have waged wars against Genoa, Pisa, Venice, Naples, France, Spain, Germany, England and the Earls of Provence. The cost of the sieges and fighting took a heavy toll on the fortifications, which were badly damaged during 1505 and 1507. The lords of Monaco also forged many diplomatic alliances in particular with their neighbor France. Finally in 1480 Lucien Grimaldi persuaded King Charles of France and the Duke of Savoy to recognize the independence of Monaco's.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, by the reign of Honore I (1522 –1581) the old fortress structures were transformed into the Palace, as we know it today. In the courtyard, architect Dominique Gallo designed a portico with two double-decked galleries, each with twelve arches, with white marble balustrades on the upper gallery, which is known as the Gallerie d'Hercule. A new wing was constructed on one side of the courtyard and Genoese painter Lucas Cambiaso was commissioned to paint frescoes on the walls. Because defense could not be overlooked, a new tower was built reinforced with additional towers and a cistern under the courtyard was enlarged hold to 3963 gallons (15,000 cubic meters) of water to sustain 1000 soldiers for a 648-day siege. The interior of the cistern, which is 16 feet (5 meters) deep by 66 feet (20 meters) long and 262 feet (80 wide), resembles a church with a vaulted ceiling resting on nine massive pillars.\r\n\r\nIn 1633, the Spanish King permanently recognized the title of \"Prince of Monaco\" to replace the \"Lord of Monaco\", making Honore II the first Prince of Monaco. Prince Honore grew up in Milan and was influenced by the intellectual salons of Paris. Like his ancestors, he had a love of the arts and became a great collector of tapestries, silver, furniture and paintings. His collection of 700 pictures included works by Raphael, Durer, Titian, Michaelangelo, Rubens and other noted local artists. He hired Jacques Catone an architect of the time, to make spectacular improvements to the palace. He masked the Genoese towers by adding on the wing facing the square.\r\n\r\nIn the main courtyard, he extended the state apartments, which also concealed the Serravalle Tower behind the building erected on either side of the new Saint Jean Baptiste chapel. He then added the grand royal entrance leading into the courtyard. These improvements took 30 years to complete, but they made the Palace of Monaco one of the most remarkable royal residences of the 17th century.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the French Revolution significantly impacted the Palace and the Grimaldi reign. In January 1793 the National Convention ordered all occupied lands be governed by independent administrations based on those of France. This ordinance applied to the Principality. Thereafter the Palace was occupied and looted by the citizens of Monaco, Roquebrune and Menton. Monaco was downgraded to a mere cantonal seat and the name changed to Fort d'Hercule. The objects of Grimaldi wealth were sold at auction. The State Apartments were turned into a military hospital for the Italian army, the throne room was used as a kitchen and the rest of the Palace designated a Poorhouse.\r\n\r\nIn May of 1814 Monaco was returned to the Grimaldi family and initially placed under the continued protection of France. By this time, however, the Palace was in such a terrible condition that the part of the east wing on the Fontvieille side had to be demolished as well as the Pavillon des Bains. Standing now in this spot is the Napoleon Museum and Palace Archives.\r\n\r\nIt is Prince Rainier III, who is credited with restoring the greatest part of the lost glory of the Palace to its present splendid state.","records":"The Archives of the Palace of Monaco hold many documents relating to European history, including the former fiefdoms of the dynasty granted by Charles V in southern Italy in 1532 (such as the Marquisate of Campagna), those granted following the Treaty of Peronne in 1641 (the Duchy of Valentinois in the Rhone Valley, marquisate of Les Baux in Provence, county of Carladès in Auvergne), or inherited by marriage (barony of Saint-Lô and county of Torigni in Normandy, seigneury of Matignon in Brittany, duchy of Mayenne, marquisate of Chilly, county of Longjumeau, duchy of Mazarin, counties of Thann, Ferrette, Rosemont, Altkirch in Alsace, etc.). ). Today, these territories are grouped together in a network based on friendship and cultural promotion: the Grimaldi Historic Sites of Monaco.","buildings":"Today, from June to October, the Palace is open to visitors. There they can see the royal courtyard paved with 3,000,000 white and colored pebbles formed into beautiful geometrical patterns. On exhibit are the 16th-century Genovese frescoes depicting scenes from mythological. The columns and the spectacular double-revolution staircase inspired by a staircase at Fontainebleau are done in Carrara marble.\r\n\r\nThe Sovereign Prince appears in the Gallery when receiving Monegasques at official events or for the presentation of a future prince or princess. But during official receptions and at the Christmas party for Monegasque children, the Prince welcomes his guests in the State Apartments.\r\n\r\nThese rooms are inlaid in marble with mosaic designs including the double R monogram of Prince Rainier III. The Florentine and Boulle furniture is from the reign of Francois I. The walls are draped in silk brocade and damask and hung with royal portraits executed by well-known artists. These portraits also document the prestigious marriages made with royal families such as Savoie-Lorraine, Matignon, Aumont-Mazarin.\r\n\r\nThese all attest to the devotion to art that is constantly being renewed.","openingTimes":" Monday-Friday: 8.30 a.m. -12.00 and 2.30 p.m. - 6.30 p.m.","conditions":"This institution is open for research.","accessibility":"The State Apartments are not accessible to those in wheelchairs.

CBF was founded following a meeting of UK Jewish community leaders with Members of Parliament. Founding members included Simon Marks, chairman and managing director of Marks & Spencer, Sir Robert Waley Cohen, managing director of Shell Oil, Lionel and Anthony de Rothschild, managing partners of N M Rothschild & Sons, and Dr Chaim Weizmann, who would later become the first President of Israel. Originally intended to provide support for German Jews who were immigrating to the British Mandate of Palestine, CBF originally funded projects such at Hebrew University, the Technion, and the Maccabi World Union so that these organisations could provide immigrants with the skills and experience needed to become functional members of society in Palestine.\r\n\r\nDue to funding problems, CBF increasingly turned its efforts away from Palestine and towards Britain. By 1935, CBF and the Jewish Refugees Committee (JRC) were funding a programme that placed Jewish scholars in British universities willing to take on faculty members and graduate students. The two programmes placed more than 200 refugees at universities, including Ernst Chain, whose subsequent work on penicillin earned him a Nobel Prize.\r\n\r\nCBF coordinated with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) in 1936 to create the Council for German Jewry, which carried out much of the pre-war operations to emigrate German Jews. Resulting from the German-Austrian Anschluss in 1938, thousands of new refugees in Austria looked to emigrate. Due to the volume of need for refugees, the Council for German Jewry attended the Évian Conference in France to push world leaders for less restrictive immigration policies, but they were largely ignored The advent of Kristallnacht later in that year exacerbated the refugee crisis, leaving the JDC overwhelmed in both financial and human resource capacity. The Council for German Jewry was eventually able to persuade the UK Home Office to admit Jews regardless of financial backing, and consequently 68,000 Jews registered before the start of war. For its part, CBF worked with the NGO Save the Children to establish the Inter-Aid Committee, which helped 471 Jewish and Christian children go to boarding schools in Britain.\r\n\r\nWorks:\r\n\r\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 prompted CBF to shift the focus of its aid efforts to support the two million Jews living there. CBF changed its name to World Jewish Relief in 1994 and has since the early 1990s focused on addressing the causes of poverty in the communities in which it works, in addition to meeting immediate needs. World Jewish Relief integrated with World Jewish Aid in 2007. World Jewish Relief currently funds three main types of projects: meeting immediate needs of vulnerable communities, securing sustainable livelihoods for those in poverty, and responding to international disasters.\r\n\r\n-Meeting Immediate Needs: World Jewish Relief works with vulnerable communities in the Former Soviet Union (FSU), primarily in Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, and Georgia, who often depend on meagre state pensions or welfare entitlements. In those areas, the charity funds homecare, medical expenses and food for clients, and supplements this programme through a Gifts in Kind programme that delivers donated materials directly to the communities in which it works. World Jewish Relief also works in communities to repair and renovate cold and insecure homes, offering their residents relief from the harsh winter weather conditions. The charity also works with partners in Ukraine to provide support for socially isolated communities, and it works with partners in Ukraine, Moldova and India to empower people living with disabilities there, with services including job training, specialist therapy, and wheelchair accessibility improvements.\r\n-Sustainable Livelihoods: World Jewish Relief launched its Livelihood Development Programme (LDP) in 2009, which currently operates in Moldova and Ukraine. The Moldova LDP works with women from vulnerable communities to provide job training, as well as Romanian language instruction, with the goal of program graduates finding employment and increased income. The Ukraine LDP works with men and women to provide job trainings and establish job centres in local Jewish Community Centres. World Jewish Relief also works with partners in Rwanda to provide educational and vocational training to orphaned and street children.\r\n-Disaster Response: World Jewish Relief leads the British Jewish community's response to international disasters, recently working in Japan, Pakistan, Haiti, and countries in East Africa. In Japan, World Jewish Relief worked with Save the Children to establish spaces for displaced children following the 2011 tsunami there. After the 2010 floods in Pakistan, World Jewish Relief worked with partners to provide immediate needs to displaced communities in Bagh District and restore homes that had been damaged or destroyed. WJR still works with partners there to train women affected by the flood in embroidery techniques. World Jewish Relief worked with Merlin following the 2010 Haiti earthquake to provide medical services for those in need, and it worked primarily in Kenya with partners to provide food services for those suffering from the East Africa food crisis.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.worldjewishrelief.org/about-us/history","generalContext":"As a UK based international Jewish charity, WJR is committed to meeting the needs of individuals and communities living in abject poverty, assisting them in the transformation of their lives and livelihoods of primarily, but not exclusively, Jewish communities across the globe. At times of major international disaster, WJR also leads the UK Jewish community’s emergency response, providing effective and appropriate interventions to those suffering from the effects of catastrophe.","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[51.5647719,-0.198747]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"gb","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/gb-003341","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/gb-003341/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/gb"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2022-11-07T12:52:50.580Z"}},{"id":"gb-003350","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"University of Southampton","parallelFormsOfName":[],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"contactPerson":"Karen Robson - Head of Archives & Special Collections","streetAddress":"Hartley Library, University of Southampton, University Road, Highfield","city":"Southampton","region":"England","postalCode":"SO17 1BJ","country":"United Kingdom","countryCode":"GB","email":["archives@soton.ac.uk"],"telephone":["+44 23 8059 2180","+1 23 8059 2721"],"fax":["+1 44 23 8059 3939"],"url":["https://www.southampton.ac.uk/archives/cataloguedatabases/jewisharchivesintro.page","https://www.southampton.ac.uk/parkes/about/index.page"]},"history":"The Hartley Library is located on Highfield campus and is one of the largest university libraries in southern England, with extensive holdings of printed books, journals and online resources.

Enriqueta was closely involved in the design and construction of the building, and in the simultaneous development of the collections.\r\n\r\nIn particular, she was personally responsible for purchasing the two foundational collections: the incomparable collection of printed books assembled by the 2nd earl Spencer (which she bought for £210,000 in 1892) and the earl of Crawford’s collection of manuscripts (costing £155,000 in 1901).\r\n\r\nBoth The John Rylands Library and Victoria University of Manchester Library had built up outstanding Special Collections. They merged in 1972.\r\n\r\nThe John Rylands Research Institute was created in 2013. Since its inception, the Institute has gained both national and international recognition.\r\n\r\nIt has been involved in attracting grants to support research on the collections from funders including the Arts and Humanities Research Council, Leverhulme Trust, British Academy and Marie Curie Foundation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, generous philanthropic donations from Amin Amiri, David Shreeve, The Soudavar Memorial Foundation and Mark Younger, amongst others, have helped to support a range of important projects.\r\n\r\nIn March 2021 The John Rylands Research Institute and the University’s iconic John Rylands Library forged an exciting new partnership as the John Rylands Research Institute and Library. The renaming signalled much closer collaboration between researchers and Library staff, in order to promote more effectively world-class research and public engagement with research, based on the remarkable special collections of The University of Manchester Library.\r\n","generalContext":"The Library’s manuscripts and archives are internationally important.

European manuscripts include hundreds of medieval codices, and there are major collections of Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Hebrew manuscripts. The Library holds the archives of hundreds of companies, trade unions, charities, social organizations and religious institutions, as well as individuals. Particular strengths include Nonconformist archives, modern literary archives, archives of The University of Manchester, and papers of individual scientists and academics from Manchester.\r\n\r\nThe rare book collections are amongst the finest in the world. They encompass almost all the landmarks of printing through five centuries, including magnificent illustrated books. Examples of fine printing, landmark works in typography, key historical texts and exquisite bookbindings. They cover a wide range of subjects: theology and philosophy; economic, social, political and military history; travel and exploration; literature, drama and music; art and archaeology; science and medicine. Highlights include: over 4,000 incunables; a remarkable collection of 16th-century Italian books; one of the greatest collections in the world covering the entire history of the printed Bible; internationally important collections of French Revolutionary material, Nonconformist literature, and scientific and medical texts.\r\n\r\nThe Library’s significant Visual Collection comprises: paintings, drawings, photographs, sculptures, textiles, ceramics, glass, archives, manuscripts, prints, papers, illustrated and painted books, and associated objects. Dating from the ancient world to the present, its representation of visual culture is excellent, of international scope, importance and interest.\r\n\r\nOPenn includes some of the items from the Hebrew Collections. The Hebrew manuscripts comprise over 400 items, dating from the 14th to the 19th centuries and ranging geographically as far afield as Morocco, Yemen and Honan in China, as well as Europe; they include magnificent Torah scrolls, prayer-books, apocryphal writings, commentaries, treatises, letters, marriage contracts and piyyûtîm.","mandates":"The John Rylands Research Institute and Library promotes research in the humanities and sciences using the astonishingly rich and diverse special collections of The University of Manchester Library.

Since then, the University Library’s Special Collections have grown substantially and encompass a number of distinct personal libraries and Repositories. The resources of Leeds University Library Special Collections are amongst the most extensive and varied of their kind in any UK academic library and include five collections which have been designated through the scheme administered by Arts Council England as of national and international distinction. The form and content of materials selected for Special Collections provide documentary evidence relevant to a wide range of disciplines including history, world literature, cultures and science. Existing collections are developed through the acquisition of additional material. New themes of collecting are developed in response to the changing trends in scholarship and to support the reinterpretation of existing collections. We regularly collaborate with donors and depositors, developing collections relevant to them. We create networks of collections, one strengthening others.

The library was funded entirely by a hugely successful local industrialist and equally far-sighted philanthropist, Lord Brotherton of Wakefield. Sadly, he did not live to see the Brotherton Library's opening in 1936.\r\n\r\nOutwardly an unadorned redbrick building, the Brotherton Library was always intended to lie behind an imposing University frontage. This materialised in the form of the Parkinson Building, which opened in 1951.\r\n\r\nThe Brotherton's round, domed reading room was deliberately modelled on that of the British Museum, but, with Yorkshire bravura, a slightly increased diameter ensured that it was larger than the southern original.\r\n\r\nAbove the reading room entrance, carved in oak, sits the University's coat of arms. It features a book inscribed with the University's motto: \"et augebitur scientia\" – \"and knowledge will be increased\".\r\n\r\nIn 1993, every book in the Brotherton was moved to allow readers into the new West Building extension (formal opening in 1995).","holdings":"Leeds University Library’s Special Collections is the home of hundreds of thousands of rare books, manuscripts, archives and art.

Sikorski Polish Institute in London was the events of September 1939, which forced the government of the Republic of Poland into exile. Then, in February 1945, after the Yalta conference, it became clear that the Allies intended to cease to recognize the Polish Government-in-Exile and its armed forces. It seemed obvious that many Poles would want to remain in the West with their families. It was thus important to secure the documents generated by that government and the armed forces. On the initiative of Col. Zygmunt Borkowski, the director of the Archive and Museum Services, a plan was established to appoint an institution modelled on the Polish Library in Paris and the Museum in Rapperswil. This plan was accepted by President Władysław Raczkiewicz and Prime Minister Tomasz Arciszewski, and in this way, in 1945, the Gen. Sikorski Historical Institute was founded, with, at its core, Department “S”  under director Dr Edmund Oppman and his wife Regina. The Institute issued an appeal to civilians, military personnel and organizations for donations of documents for its collections. Some people made bequests ensuring that their valuable collections would later pass to the Institute’s archive. This archive is now generally regarded as holding the most important Polish émigré collections in the world. Together with the museum and the two libraries it is an integral part of the Institute. ","administrativeStructure":" In 1988 the institute’s management board and archive service merged with those of the Polish Underground Movement Study Trust, though it remains an autonomous institution.\r\n\r\nThe Institute is governed by up to 80 Full Members, who have voting rights. They elect Trustee Directors, with a Chairman at their head, who are responsible for the everyday running of the Institute.","holdings":"The archival holding today is the product of the fusion of several different archival collections from the period of the occupation, the prewar period, and the postwar period; it runs to some 700 linear metres of files and covers the period 1918-1990.  These materials are of fundamental significance to the study of Polish history in the years 1939-1945, though they do not constitute all of the archival material generated in this period by Polish authorities and institutions – research should also extend to the collections of the Central Archive of Modern Records (AAN) in Warsaw, the archive of the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, California, and the Józef Piłsudski Institute of America in New York. The majority of these materials have now been processed and are inventoried. A card file referencing some 40,000 people, is also kept.\r\nThe Institute’s holding is divided into the following sections:\r\n \r\n1)\tThe diary of Gen. Władysław Sikorski,\r\n2)\tDocuments relating to the 1939 September Campaign, \r\n3)\tRecords of particular government and state administrative offices relating to the president, government, ministries, embassies, consulates and missions, and other official state bodies, \r\n4)\tCollections relating to Polskie Siły Zbrojne (PSZ, the Polish Armed Forces), from Sztab Naczelnego Wodza (Commander-in-Chief) to materials from the various military units, \r\n5)\tOver 10,000 eye-witness accounts by Poles who ended up in Russia or were deported there after 1939, \r\n6)\tAround 300 private collections (legacies and papers).\r\n \r\nThe museum’s collections also include photographs, bills, posters and ephemera, plans and maps, films, audio tapes, records, video recordings, philatelic and numismatic collections, and a separate Personal Archive.

This position has remained to the present day.\r\n \r\nThe Centre was originally based at the Oriental Institute in Pusey Lane, Oxford, and later moved to rented premises at 45 St Giles’ (a building owned by St John’s College) in order to accommodate the increase in staff numbers and to provide more teaching rooms. At the same time, the Centre acquired the use of Yarnton Manor, an early seventeenth-century house and rural estate just outside Oxford, in 1973 through the generous action of the Charles Wolfson Charitable Trust.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, in the autumn of 2000, the Centre’s physical integration with the University was advanced through the formation of the Oxford University Teaching and Research Unit in Hebrew and Jewish Studies, later known as the Hebrew and Jewish Studies Unit of the University of Oxford. It was housed on the Oriental Institute’s third floor, the construction of which was funded by the Centre’s supporters.\r\n \r\nIn September 2014, the activities of the Unit were brought together with the research activities which had been housed in Yarnton and the combined operations of the Centre were relocated to the Clarendon Institute, a late-Victorian building in central Oxford owned by the University.\r\n \r\nSeveral years later, in September 2018, the research activities of the Centre were incorporated into a new Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies of the University of Oxford. This new academic Centre, which reports to the University through the Faculty of Oriental Studies, is fully funded by the charitable Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies and is directed by the Centre’s President.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, the OCHJS celebrated its 50th anniversary.","generalContext":"The Centre’s mission is to support, at the highest level, the full scope of Hebrew and Jewish Studies from antiquity to the contemporary world.

This took under the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act 1939 (c89), an Act intended to prohibit commercial or financial dealings with the enemy, and to preserve enemy assets in the UK in order to prevent the enemy from benefiting from them. The enemy countries included Nazi Germany and its allies, as well as countries under Nazi occupation. After the war, the assets of the occupied countries were released from British Government control, but the assets of the 'belligerent' countries were distributed to British creditors whose assets had been confiscated by the enemy countries. An exception was made for victims of Nazi persecution and soon after the war; Nazi victims or their heirs could claim the return of their assets.\r\n\r\nIn Spring 1997, following public concern that there were still many assets belonging to victims that had not been returned, the British Government conducted research into the history of the administration of Enemy Property. Searches were made in the surviving records in the TWE (Trading With the Enemy) series, originally created by the Treasury and the Board of Trade. One result of this research was the compilation of a database of the assets seized from residents of belligerent enemy countries.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government saw the situation as an injustice that had to be addressed and, in June 1998, commissioned Lord Archer of Sandwell to advise on the design of a suitable compensation scheme. In December 1998, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced the compensation scheme administered by an independent Enemy Property Compensation Advisory Panel. Shortly after its formation, this Panel was known as the Enemy Property Claims Assessment Panel (EPCAP).\r\n\r\nEPCAP launched the Enemy Property Payments Scheme in April 1999 under the Chairmanship of Lord Archer of Sandwell, sitting with two teams of assessors who were expert in finance and ethnic minority issues. The initial period for submission of claims ended on 30th September 1999. Each claim was then considered by EPCAP. Claims could be made in respect of any property in the UK confiscated by Her Majesty's Government under British legislation on enemy property or trading with the enemy if not already returned, and compensation not already been paid to cover its full value. The Government undertook to pay compensation on the basis of wartime values increased by the change in the retail prices index. Compensation was to be paid to victims of Nazi persecution who owned such property when it was confiscated, and to others who could demonstrate that they were likely to have been the beneficial owner of such property if it had not been confiscated, if they or the original owner suffered Nazi persecution.\r\n\r\nOn 8th July 2004, the Minister Patricia Hewitt announced the closure of the Enemy Property Payment Scheme. At that time, the Panel reported that 220,000 separate items were confiscated and either sold or returned to the original owners. They had received a total of 1,121 claims, of which 377 were successful. Payments made under the Scheme amounted to £16.2 million. There remained but 22 cases outstanding; and only one item (a gilt bracelet and diamond tie-pin) unclaimed. Following continued interest in the scheme it became clear that its formal closure would have to be deferred and claims will still be considered in exceptional circumstances.","records":"The National Archives holds 33 volumes of the Trading with the Enemy Branch of the Treasury and the Board of Trade, containing a history of the administration of enemy property during and after the Second World War, in Series BT 216.

Charles Pathé adopted the national emblem of France, the cockerel, as the trademark for his company. After the company, now called Compagnie Générale des Éstablissements Pathé Frère Phonographes & Cinématographes, invented the cinema newsreel with Pathé-Journal. French Pathé began its newsreel in 1908 and opened a newsreel office in Wardour Street, London in 1910.\r\n\r\nThe newsreels were shown in the cinema and were silent until 1928. At first, they ran for about four minutes and were issued fortnightly. During the early days, the camera shots were taken from a stationary position but the Pathé newsreels captured events such as Franz Reichelt's fatal parachute jump from the Eiffel Tower and suffragette Emily Davison's fatal injury by a racehorse at the 1913 Epsom Derby.\r\n\r\nDuring the First World War, the cinema newsreels were called the Pathé Animated Gazettes, and for the first time this provided newspapers with competition. After 1918, British Pathé started producing a series of cinemazines, in which the newsreels were much longer and more comprehensive. By 1930, British Pathé was covering news, entertainment, sport, culture, and women's issues through programmes including the Pathétone Weekly, the Pathé Pictorial, the Gazette and Eve’s Film Review.\r\n\r\nIn 1927, the company sold British Pathé (both the feature film and the newsreel divisions) to First National. (French Pathé News continued until 1980, and the library is now part of the Gaumont-Pathé collection.) Pathé changed hands again in 1933, when it was acquired by British International Pictures, which was later known as Associated British Picture Corporation. In 1958, it was sold again to Warner Bros. and became Warner-Pathé. Pathé eventually stopped producing the cinema newsreel in February 1970 as it could no longer compete with television. During the newsreels' run, the narrators included Bob Danvers-Walker, Dwight Weist, Dan Donaldson, André Baruch and Clem McCarthy among others.","administrativeStructure":"The library itself was sold with Associated British Picture to EMI Films and then others, including The Cannon Group (which split the feature film and newsreel divisions) and the Daily Mail and General Trust, before relaunching in its own right in 2009.

Parliament’s vision was for a single institution at the heart of the UK’s information network, which would aid scientific and technological research, business, the arts and humanities.\r\n\r\nTo make this happen, several organisations were brought together to create a national library.\r\n\r\nThe British Museum Library, founded in 1753, contained one of the world’s largest collections of books, manuscripts and periodicals, both contemporary and antique, British and foreign.\r\n\r\nIt was created as ‘one general repository’ to hold the collections of Sir Hans Sloane, Sir Robert Cotton and Robert and Edward Harley. When it inherited the library of George III in 1823, its printed books doubled in number, prompting a move to the site of the current British Museum.\r\n\r\nOpening in 1857, the Library’s Round Reading Room – with its magnificent domed roof – became an iconic destination in the literary landscape of London. George Gissing used it as the setting of his 1891 novel New Grub Street, describing it as ‘the valley of the shadow of books’, while lamenting the difficulties of obtaining a Reader ticket. Its roof was also used in the climax of Alfred Hitchcock’s film Blackmail (1929).\r\n\r\nThe room welcomed many famous visitors including Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Karl Marx, George Bernard Shaw and Virginia Woolf. Lenin too applied for a Reader ticket, adopting the pseudonym Jacob Richter to cover his tracks from the Russian authorities.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, some of our most precious treasures were moved to a secure cave in Aberystwyth, with round the clock guards. Meanwhile, the Newspaper Library in Colindale, north London, suffered substantial damage from bombing and some of the collection had to be transferred to quarries in Wiltshire while repairs were made.\r\n\r\nOne of the first challenges for the new British Library in 1973 was to find a premises to bring together these disparate collections and institutions.\r\n\r\nAn old rail goods yard in St Pancras would become our home. Opening its doors to the public in November 1997 and receiving an official inauguration by HM Queen Elizabeth II the following June, the Library became the largest public building constructed in Britain in the last 100 years.\r\n\r\nAlthough its modernist design by architect Sir Colin St. John Wilson originally divided critics, the building achieved Grade 1 listed status in 2015. Today it lies at the centre of an area of huge regeneration, home to the Knowledge Quarter and Google.","mandates":"The British Library Board is a non-departmental public body operating at arm’s length from its sponsor, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). The Chief Executive is also the Accounting Officer appointed by DCMS, and a management agreement with the Secretary of State sets out our Grant in Aid allocation and funding conditions.\r\nThe British Library has full charitable status, but has exemption under the Charities Act 2011 from registration and oversight by the Charity Commission. DCMS acts as the Library's principal regulator for charity law purposes.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003, the British Library receives a copy of every printed publication issued in the UK. The Legal Deposit Libraries (Non-Print Works) Regulations 2013 extended this arrangement to include UK websites and electronic publications.\r\n\r\nSince 2014, the British Library Board has been responsible for administering payments to authors under the terms of the Public Lending Right Act 1979.\r\n\r\nThe British Library Act requires the Board to manage the Library “as a national centre for reference, study and bibliographical and other information services in relation both to scientific and technological matters and to the humanities”. It also sets out the statutory aims of the Library, which must “make its services available to the public and, in particular, to institutions of education and learning, other libraries and industry”. It may carry out and sponsor research, contribute to the expenses of library authorities or other persons providing library facilities, and make any part of its collections, or of its premises, available in connection with events of an educational, literary or cultural nature.

As it announced at the outset, it aimed at representing all those Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria for whom Judaism is a determining factor in their outlook on life. It thereby differentiated itself from the other organisations claiming to represent the refugees from Nazism in Britain, principally the Free German League of Culture and the Austrian Centre, which had been established by politically conscious refugees, with the intention of persuading their members to return after the war to Germany and Austria respectively.\r\n\r\nThe AJR, by contrast, defined itself as a Jewish self-help organisation. Its founding executive consisted of Orthodox Jews, Liberal Jews and Zionists, in an attempt to appeal as widely as possible to the Jewish refugees in Britain its membership, however, would soon reflect the preponderance of secularised, assimilated Jews among those who had fled to Britain after 1933. Under its long-serving General Secretary, Werner Rosenstock (1941-82), the AJR settled in premises in the Finchley Road area of Hampstead, north-west London, where it was to remain until the early years of the twenty-first century.\r\n\r\nThe AJR began at once to campaign on behalf of its membership, then still classed as ‘enemy aliens’ formerly of German nationality. It sought to bring home to the British public that its members supported the war effort against Germany unconditionally; accordingly, it demanded the removal of the restrictions placed on them as ‘enemy aliens’, which prevented them from contributing to the Allied cause to the best of their ability. As the war neared its end, the AJR campaigned against attempts to repatriate the refugees against their will to their countries of origin. It also pressed for the refugees to be permitted to apply for British citizenship, thus enabling them to settle securely in their adopted homeland. Many thousands of Jewish refugees were to become British by naturalisation in the later 1940s, laying the foundation for a flourishing community that combined its German-Jewish social culture with a strong sense of integration into British society. Since 1946, the AJR has published its monthly journal, AJR Information, which was renamed AJR Journal in 2000.\r\n\r\nThe AJR also provided important services to its members. One of its first appointments was a trained social worker, who offered advice and support to refugees suffering from the emotional dislocation of forced emigration, from the difficulties of adapting to life in a foreign country, from problems of employment and accommodation, and not least from the burden of anxiety about family members left behind in Nazi-controlled areas. After the war, the AJR involved itself in the struggle to secure restitution for the Jewish refugees for the losses they had suffered under Nazi persecution. The campaign for Wiedergutmachung was to remain a central concern for the AJR for many decades.\r\n\r\nAs its membership aged, the AJR largely abandoned political campaigning and concentrated on providing social services for its members; most notably, it cooperated in the running of old age homes for elderly and incapacitated refugees. Over many years, the AJR has established a proud record of serving its membership, which now includes Holocaust survivors from across Europe.","administrativeStructure":"The Association of Jewish Refugees (AJR) is a company limited by guarantee (8220991) and a charity registered with the Charity Commission for England and Wales (1149882).\r\n\r\nThe policies, priorities and programmes of the AJR are decided by a Board of Directors (known informally as Trustees), who are responsible for the charitable company’s overall financial policy, the disbursement of financial support, and for managing funds to benefit the membership.\r\n\r\nThe serving Trustees are: Mike Karp  (Chairman), Eleanor Angel, Gaby Glassman, Frank Harding, Danny Kalman, Andrew Kaufman MBE, Miriam Kingsley, Stephen Kon, Anthony Spiro OBE, Philippa Strauss and Mark White.\r\n\r\nThe AJR relies heavily on voluntary donations and legacies to help meet our commitments and to enable us to continue to provide our outstanding services.

In 2016, AJR piloted this educational project that would connect generations through first hand testimonies. Writer and researcher, Ann Rosen and independent film producer Sharon Portner of The Film People collaborated to put together five films.\r\n\r\nThe five pairs of interviews represent a diverse range of survivor experience and included survivors from Germany, Poland and Hungary. They describe in detail their experiences in ghettos, labour camps, as individual child slave workers, and on prison barges and death marches.\r\n\r\nFor each survivor, background research was carried out prior to the interview and a list of around 100 questions was prepared. These covered life prior to the war, deportation and imprisonment and post-war experiences. In all cases, several research gathering meetings took place prior to the filming. Researchers met and chose grandparents and grandchildren who had a strong rapport and were comfortable with each other, so that they were able to have a dialogue for several hours about painful and troubling life events. In some cases, several grandchildren interviewed their grandparents in turn.\r\n\r\nEach recording took around half a day and editing was kept to a minimum, in order to give an authentic representation of the encounter between grandparents and their grandchildren.

It was a complicated project brought to fruition by many committees but guided particularly by the VHCS Executive Director at the time, Ronnie Tessler, and Board member, Arthur Pouchet. The architects, Peter Rees and Jack Lutsky, and Museum of Anthropology consultant, David Cunningham and, were key participants. The Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre opened in the fall of 1994 with the inaugural exhibit Anne Frank in The World: 1929–1945, an internationally acclaimed exhibition produced by the Anne Frank Center USA, New York.\r\n\r\nRobert Krell served as founding President of the Board of Directors of the Vancouver Holocaust Centre Society from its inception to 1998, when Robbie Waisman assumed the Presidency.

This prompted the Canadian Jewish Congress (CJC) Central Region to work with the TJHS to establish an organization that would preserve records of Jewish communities across Ontario. At a CJC Central Region Officers’ meeting in 1973, TJHS president Victor Sefton proposed that the Historical Society’s Archives Committee become an official arm of the CJC. After approving the proposal, the CJC Central Region allocated a budget for operation of the Archives, forming one archival organization that operated under the umbrella of the CJC Central Region.\r\n\r\nSince 1973, the OJA has undergone unofficial and official name changes. When first established the OJA was called the Canadian Jewish Congress Central Region Archives. After the Toronto Jewish Congress (TJC) formed in 1976, the OJA became accountable to the TJC but continued to report to the CJC Central Region. OJA letterhead and publicity material during this period occasionally bore the name Toronto Jewish Congress / Canadian Jewish Congress Central Region Archives. When the Archives became a legal corporation in 1977, the corporation was named the Ontario Jewish Archives Foundation but the public name remained unchanged. \r\n\r\nIn 1992, the TJC and CJC transferred responsibility for the archives to the United Jewish Appeal (UJA) Federation, and the archives’ public name officially became the Ontario Jewish Archives (OJA). The OJA remains a department of UJA Federation today.

Until 1947 , the oldest archival documents were kept in crates in the then rectorate building in Voldersstraat. After the tenure of Rector E. Blancquaert, these crates were transferred to the University Library, preserving valuable and unique pieces such as the student registers and record books.\r\n\r\nIn 1954, the chief librarian KG Van Acker took the initiative to make the archive more accessible to the public. This was undertaken by students in 1955. Prof. J. Dhondt appointed the archives’ first staff member in 1964 and the rectorate correspondence was opened to public consultation. \r\n\r\nAt this time, increasing bureaucratisation meant that the university administration was confronted with a growing mountain of paperwork. This led to the establishment of the University Archives in 1972 as a 'central' service under the supervision of Prof. K. De Clerck. The new service was housed in a wing of the Rommelaere complex on Baertsoenkaai.\r\n\r\nSince the creation of the University Archives, several initiatives have been taken to bring its academic heritage to the attention of the general public. In 1976, the University began publishing a series works that highlighted various facets of the institution’s history. In addition, several exhibitions were organised.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1980 the University Archives moved to the Pand (Onderbergen) and in 1987 it was given a permanent home in the basement of the rectorate building in Sint-Pietersnieuwstraat. An additional depot space was provided on the university campus on Krijgslaan (building S8).\r\n","holdings":"The collection of the University Archives consist of the archives of its governing bodies the administration, the faculties, the academic departments, university associations and student records.\r\n\r\nThe oldest documents date back to the foundation of the university in 1817.

In order to improve the accessibility of documentary resources for teaching and research, the digital copies can be read online, freely and without charge.\r\n\r\nSince July 2013, following the acquisition of a scanner (Fujitsu), the Digitale has undertaken a larger project (approximately 10,000 volumes): the digitisation of theses defended at the ULB since its foundation and kept in the libraries.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this digitisation are multiple: to free up storage space and, by a communicating effect, to offer more working space for library users and to improve the accessibility and visibility of ULB's scientific research.\r\n\r\nTo date, the theses have been almost completely digitised and digitised, which makes it possible to search the text by keyword.

Among the founders – primarily Mizrachi (religious Zionist) Jews – were rabbi M.A. Amiel of the Shomre Hadas community and E. Karlin. Chief Rabbi Ernest Wiener became one of its spiritual leaders. \r\n\r\nThe choice for education in modern Hebrew was daring but ultimately proved successful. In religious terms, Tachkemoni was (and is) less orthodox than the Jesode-Hatora-Beth-Jacob (JHBJ) school. The primary school was complemented by a kindergarten in 1926 and a section for girls in 1937. From 1927 the school organised evening classes of Dutch, French and English to stimulate the integration of the parents of the many foreign students. Before the Second World War the Tachkemoni school had about 675 pupils. \r\n\r\nDuring the Occupation, the school was taken over by the Vereniging der Joden in België – Association des Juifs en Belgique and was called Joodse school van Antwerpen until its closure in 1943. The buildings were then used as a school for the Duits-Vlaamse Arbeidsgemeenschap, a collaborationist organisation supported by the SS. After the short-lived experiment as a unified Jewish school in Antwerp (with JHBJ)(5-25 October 1944), the Tachkemoni school resumed classes in early May 1945 as a separate institution, with 61 pupils. The infrastructure, damaged by bombings, was restored with funding from the Verenigde Israëlitische Gemeenten (and its hevra kadisha) and funds collected by Antwerp Jews exiled in New York. The lack of teachers for Jewish courses (and Hebrew) was solved by recruitment in Israel, which, however, often resulted in practical problems. The decision to organise mixed classes also dates from the immediate post-war period; initially a pragmatic choice due to the lack of students, the system remains in place in the present. \r\n\r\nThe further expansion of the school was made possible by the financial support of the Shomre Hadas community and the Claims Conference. An athenaeum (high school) was created in 1949 and subsidised by the State from 1959. A new kindergarten opened in 1957; the school has had its own synagogue since 1966. \r\n\r\nToday, the Tachkemoni school offers pre-primary, primary and secondary education. Both secular and Jewish subjects are taught. The Hebrew courses in particular are meant to provide the pupils with the necessary preparation to study at Israeli universities. At present, the Tachkemoni school has about 570 pupils.","holdings":"Part of the archives were likely lost as a result of various relocations and renovations in the last decades.

Over the centuries, Ostend was not spared from fires, wars, looting and its traces can be found directly in the city archive.  \r\n\r\nThe first traces of the city archives’ existence date back to the Siege of Ostend (1601-1604). They reportedly escaped destruction thanks to their timely transfer to Vlissingen and Middelburg in Zeeland. Afterwards this archive was brought back to Ostend only to be relocated to Zeeland for a second time at the end of the 18th century as a result of the French invasion. It is not known when the archive returned, but there is an inventory dating from 24 August 1814. The successive relocations apparently also left their traces because the inventory shows that the vast majority of the documents date from the 18th century. In 1900 the City Library moved to a separate building. The old archive (from 1600 - 1815) moved with it, while the modern archive remained in the Town Hall.\r\n\r\nDuring the First World War (1914-1918) this modern archive was transferred to the cellars of the Town Hall. In 1925, Carlo Loontiens, the librarian who had just been appointed archivist, had the archives covering the period of 1815 to 1832 transferred to the city library. The city archive covering the period 1832 to 1925 remained at the Town Hall on the Wapenplein. Two documents and three hundred proclamations from the Spanish, Austrian, French and Dutch period were transferred to the Museum in Fort Napoleon. \r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out on 10 May 1940, a stream of refugees gradually started to flow through Ostend and from 19 May 1940 onwards the town was subject to intense attacks. The Town Hall and the City Library were completely destroyed on the night of 27/28 May 1940.\r\n\r\nAfter the fire of 1940, space was made available in the cellars of the courthouse to house the new archival items. \r\n\r\nAfter the war no effort was made to reconstruct the city archive and over the years it acquired a rather ambiguous status: the curator of the museum managed the \"archive before 1940\", while archival material dated after 1940 received no attention.\r\n\r\nAfter the war, the “archive before 1940” was actually an empty box, with the exception of an 18th-century building file that was on loan at the time of the fire and later returned. \r\n \r\nThe archive after 1940 was kept in the Town Hall, first in the courthouse and then later transferred to the new Town Hall. With the mergers of Stene and Zandvoorde with Ostend, the city archive acquired new elements of archival patrimony. \r\n\r\nBecause of the ever-increasing size of the archive, the Mayor and Aldermen approved an Archive Policy Plan in August 1996. This involved the creation of the \"Ostend City Archives\" service (August 1996), the recruitment of a university-level archivist (August 1997), the opening of a reading room (December 1997) and the appointment of two additional staff members.\r\n","openingTimes":" Monday to Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.\r\n\r\n Thursday from 9 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.\t \r\n\r\n Closed Friday, Saturday and Sunday ","conditions":"The City Archives can only be consulted after introducing a written request via email, mail or fax.\r\n\r\nVisitors to the City Archive must fill in a consultation request form on their first visit on which they provide their name, address, telephone number and the purpose of their research. \r\n\r\nFor each request to view an archive document, visitors must complete a special application form. \r\n\r\nVisitors cannot demand that the requested documents be made immediately available.

The law stipulated that the archives of institutions and administrations abolished by the French authorities were to be collected and preserved at the regional metropolis of each newly created ‘Département’. In 1831, the archive depot in Brussels was officially named the “Archives Générales du Royaume” (National Archives of Belgium). By virtue of the Royal Decree of 17 December 1851, the “Archives de l’État dans les Provinces” (State Archives in the Provinces) were placed under the authority of the National Archivist.\r\n\r\nNow broadly known as ‘the State Archives of Belgium', the National Archives and the State Archives in the Provinces are a federal academic organisation that forms part of the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO). The State Archives are made up of the National Archives in Brussels and 17 State Archives that are distributed throughout the country. The State Archives’ role is to ensure the proper preservation of archival documents produced and managed by the state authorities. In order to fulfil its responsibilities, the State Archives issue directives and recommendations; conduct inspections and organise training for civil servants. The State Archives also act as an advisory body for the construction and preparation of premises for the conservation of archives and for the organisation of archive management within public institutions. The State Archives obtain and preserve (following sorting) archival documents that are at least 30 years old from courts, tribunals, public authorities, notaries and from the private sector and private individuals (companies, politicians, associations and societies, influential families, etc. that have played an important role in society). They ensure that public archives are transferred according to strict archival standards.\r\n\r\nFrom 1996 onwards, the State Archives in Eupen became one of the departments of the State Archives of Belgium. As of 2013, they are under the operational management of the State Archives in the Walloon Provinces. ","buildings":"On 1 March 1989, the State Archives moved into two premises made available by the city of Eupen, namely an office and a 75 m² warehouse in an imposing and remarkable building constructed between 1724 and 1728 for a cloth merchant. ","holdings":"The State Archives in Eupen preserve the records of public and private institutions that have or had their seat on the territory of today’s jurisdiction of Eupen, which is located in the Province of Liège. Today, this territory covers the municipal areas of Eupen, Amblève, Bullange, Burg-Reuland, Butgenbach, La Calamine, Lontzen, Raeren and Saint-Vith, which corresponds to the territory of the German-speaking community of Belgium\r\n\r\nBefore 1796, the major archive creators were primarily the alderman courts, communes, notary publics, and parishes. In the 19th century, courts, public administrations, social welfare centres, and church councils emerged as significant contributors to the State Archives in Eupens' collections, as have the government and the ministry of the German-speaking Community since 1984. Moreover, over 100 records from individuals and associations of private law and a collection of maps and plans can be found in the Archives' collections.\r\n\r\nThe records preserved at the State Archives in Eupen date back to the 14th century. The parish registers and civil status registers regarding the churches and communes in the jurisdiction of Eupen can only be consulted via microfilm or backup copy.\r\n\r\nThe State Archives in Eupen also preserve the Historical Records (16th to mid-20th century) and the newspaper collection (1827-today) of the city of Eupen.\r\n\r\nThe Historical Library of the State Archives in Eupen counts some 30,000 volumes of different origin about regional history, archives administration, general history and ecclesiastical history, numerous inventories, reference editions, and a large collection of laws from the 17th to the 20th centuries.\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed overview of the Archives' collections, see:\r\n\r\n- http://arch.arch.be/index.php?l=de&m=praktische-informationen&r=unsere-lesesale&d=eupen#archives-conservees (in German) \r\n\r\n- http://arch.arch.be/index.php?l=fr&m=en-pratique&r=nos-salles-de-lecture&d=eupen#archives-conservees (in French)\r\n\r\n- http://arch.arch.be/index.php?l=nl&m=praktische-info&r=onze-leeszalen&d=eupen#archives-conservees (in Dutch)","openingTimes":"Tuesday to Friday 9 a.m. 4:30 p.m.\r\n\r\nIn July and August: closed between 12 p.m. and 1 p.m.\r\n\r\nClosed on Mondays, Saturdays, Sunday, public holidays and inventorying days.","conditions":"Since 1 June 2018, access to the reading rooms of the State Archives is free.

Its tasks are described in the Organic Law of November 1998 on the Belgian Intelligence Services.\r\nThe ADIV is part of the Ministry of Defence and as such depends on the financial, human and material resources allocated to Defence. The Service employs both military and civilian personnel.\r\nBecause its tasks and areas of competence are closely related to the military world, the ADIV is generally referred to as the military intelligence service. This distinguishes it from its civilian counterpart, State Security, with which it actively cooperates.","mandates":"The General Intelligence and Security Service (ADIV) is Belgium's military intelligence and security service, headed by Vice Admiral Wim Robberecht. \r\n\r\nJust as for the State Security Service (VSSE), the legal tasks of the ADIV are described in the Law of 30 November 1998 regulating the intelligence and security services.\r\n\r\nTo carry out its tasks, the ADIV comes under the authority of the Minister of Defence. For its strategy, the ADIV, like the VSSE, is subject to the directives of the National Security Council (NVR).\r\n\r\nIn Belgium, the intelligence and security services and thus the ADIV are monitored by the Standing Committee on Supervision of the Intelligence Services. In addition to this Standing Committee I as a supervisory body, the administrative commission (the 'Bim Commission') also exercises control over the use of specific and exceptional intelligence methods.\r\n\r\nCompared to the VSSE, the ADIV has a number of specific capacities in the various domains of intelligence and security, for instance a large cyber capacity, an extensive geographical service, specific eavesdropping capabilities, etc. In addition, the ADIV is legally permitted to use Special Intelligence Measures (BIMs) outside the country's borders and, subject to a specific procedure, can break into computers, intercept communications and record images outside Belgium.\r\n\r\nBased on the recommendations of the parliamentary enquiry committee, the VSSE and the ADIV are working on closer cooperation. Areas of synergy have been identified and are increasingly being exploited to increase the joint efficiency of the two services and thus continue to guarantee the security of our population, which is the most important role of these two bodies.\r\n\r\nA National Strategic Intelligence Plan (NSIP) describes this cooperation in detail.","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[50.87154,4.41982]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"be","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-002130","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-002130/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2022-10-24T09:13:16.722Z"}},{"id":"be-002150","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Archives de la Ville de Liège","parallelFormsOfName":["City Archives of Liège"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Rue de la Tonne; Bâtiment BM67","city":"Liège","region":"Wallonia","postalCode":"4000","country":"Belgium","countryCode":"BE","email":["archives@liege.be","archives.liege@arch.be"],"telephone":["+32 42 21 66 55","+32 42 52 03 93  "],"fax":["+32 42 23 35 91"],"url":["https://www.liege.be/fr/vie-communale/services-communaux/gestion-documentaire-et-archives","https://www.arch.be/index.php?l=nl&m=praktische-info&r=onze-leeszalen&d=luik"]},"records":"The department receives all documents produced or received by the municipal administration in the course of its work.\r\n\r\nEach year, the department receives documents from individuals, associations or companies as donations, deposits or legacies.

The State Archives also act as an advisory body for the construction and preparation of premises for the conservation of archives and for the organisation of archive management within public institutions. The State Archives obtain and preserve (following sorting) archival documents that are at least 30 years old from courts, tribunals, public authorities, notaries and from the private sector and private individuals (companies, politicians, associations and societies, influential families, etc. that have played an important role in society). They ensure that public archives are transferred according to strict archival standards.\r\n\r\nThe State Archives in Bruges can currently hold up to 25 linear kilometres of archives. Its new building, opened to the public in 2013, currently holds some 13.5 km of archives, including some 5.5 km of archives that, until recently, were held by State Archives in Beveren.","buildings":"The new State Archives comprise a new, separate volume for housing the archives and the public spaces, next to it, adjacent to the Justice House, the renovated Red Cross building with offices, workspaces, a conference and an exhibition hall, and in between a new square that forms a link between the two buildings and also between the Predikherenrei and the Langestraat. The new building nestles in the urban fabric and engages in a dialogue with its surroundings. It is no taller than the nearby Justice House, and its roof structure is fully integrated into the rhythm of the surrounding roofs.\r\n\r\nThe building is the architectural representation of what it contains. The façades resemble a loose pile of paper, an illusion reinforced by the long bricks used as facing bricks. The roof, on the other hand, resembles a crumpled paper stack.\r\n\r\nThe open reading room looks out onto the traffic-free square and the Predikherenrei. At the back are the non-public archive rooms, which are easily accessible for deliveries via a covered unloading bay.\r\n\r\nThe archive itself is on the first floor of the new building. It is equipped with the latest storage technology. A horizontal layout with mobile double racks of five metres high and an integrated intermediate floor ensure that the archives can be stored in a compact but orderly way.\r\n\r\nBoth the reading room and the offices are quickly accessible from the archive room. In addition, the first floor of the new building is also connected to the offices on the first floor of the Red Cross building by a transparent footbridge.\r\n\r\nUnderneath the new building is a public, underground car park with space for about 200 cars, spread over two levels.\r\n\r\nThe loose arrangement emphasises the transition between old and new, between the renovated Red Cross building and Justice House on the one hand, and the new, modern volume on the other. At the same time, it creates a new urban square that separates hard and soft traffic. The square is a pedestrian zone connecting Predikherenrei and Langestraat.","holdings":"The State Archives in Bruges manage the archives transferred by the public institutions and notaries of the former judicial districts of Bruges, Ypres, Furnes and the province of West Flanders (partial archives).\r\n\r\nThe State Archives in Bruges also holds the archives of municipalities, religious institutions, parishes, public social welfare centres, polders, water boards, companies, and influential associations, families and politicians in the region.\r\n\r\nThe historical library of the State Archives in Bruges contains some 20,000 titles, including 200 old printed documents.

The CBR was dissolved in August 1945 and its services were transferred to the Ministry of War Victims, created in February 1945 to take action to help civilian victims of the war. In 1946, the services of this department were transferred to the Ministry of Reconstruction, and then to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in 1952. In 2001, the Directorate-General War Victims was included in the Federal Public Service - Social Security.

Founded in 1969, it collects archives and documentation, carries out research and organises academic and public events. The centre's documentation is searchable through its [online catalogues](http://www.cegesoma.be/cms/catalogues_en.php) and can be consulted in the public reading room of Centre's historic Art Deco building at the Square de l'Aviation in Brussels. In 2016, Cegesoma was integrated into the Belgian State Archives.","mandates":"Since the first of January 2016, the institution is the fourth Operational Directorate (OD4) of the State Archives (see programme act of 26 December 2015 and royal order of 23 May 2016) .

The collection includes personal archives, archives of private organisations, of collaborators and collaborationist movements, of resistance fighters and resistance organisations, of official institutions and services that existed only between 1939 and 1946 (based under the terms of an agreement with the General State Archives) and of microfilms and photocopies of foreign archival collections. Some collections are already accessible online. The library comprises about 62,000 books and brochures, more than 4,000 periodicals and newspapers and a large collection of press cuttings. Originally, the collection focused on the history of the Second World War. The library of the Information Service of the Belgian Government in London and the collaborationist press which, at the Liberation, was seized by the military justice authorities provided the basis for the collection. The gap in the collection that existed when the Centre was created in 1969 is gradually being filled, especially through donations. At the same time, the library has systematically acquired newly published works on Belgium and the Second World War. From the 1990s onwards, the library has also focused on other areas and fields of interest. The Centre acquires publications on political and cultural world history of the short 20th century, from the First World War to the 1970s. Within this large field, priority has been given to themes with a relevance to contemporary conflicts such as nationalism, ethnicity, racism, migration, communism, the extreme right, colonisation/decolonisation and genocides. These are also the themes that determine the Centre's acquisition policy of current national and international periodicals (more than 65 subscriptions). The collection of periodicals and newspapers which permanently is in permanent expansion thanks to donations and exchanges is particularly varied. “Popular” weeklies as well as periodicals of political parties, social organisations and action groups are all included in the collections. Moreover, the Centre holds the largest collection of clandestine papers in Belgium. CEGESOMA has an audiovisual department comprising photographic archives, poster and videotape collections, sound documents and interviews.","openingTimes":"From Tuesday to Friday without interruption from 9 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.","researchServices":"CEGESOMA's reading room is free to access, but registration is required.

In comparison with other provincial capitals, this was rather late.","generalContext":"The French law of 26 October 1796 (5 Brumaire V) laid the foundations of the organisational structure of the present-day Belgian State Archives. The law stipulated that the archives of institutions and administrations abolished by the French authorities were to be collected and preserved at the regional metropolis of each newly created ‘Département’. In 1831, the archive depot in Brussels was officially named the “Archives Générales du Royaume” (National Archives of Belgium). By virtue of the Royal Decree of 17 December 1851, the “Archives de l’État dans les Provinces” (State Archives in the Provinces) were placed under the authority of the National Archivist.\r\n\r\nNow broadly known as ‘the State Archives of Belgium’, the National Archives and the State Archives in the Provinces are a federal academic organisation that forms part of the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO). The State Archives are made up of the National Archives in Brussels and 17 State Archives that are distributed throughout the country. The State Archives’ role is to ensure the proper preservation of archival documents produced and managed by the state authorities. In order to fulfil its responsibilities, the State Archives issue directives and recommendations; conduct inspections and organise training for civil servants. The State Archives also act as an advisory body for the construction and preparation of premises for the conservation of archives and for the organisation of archive management within public institutions. The State Archives obtain and preserve (following sorting) archival documents that are at least 30 years old from courts, tribunals, public authorities, notaries and from the private sector and private individuals (companies, politicians, associations and societies, influential families, etc. that have played an important role in society). They ensure that public archives are transferred according to strict archival standards.\r\n\r\nAround 1975, the State Archives in Antwerp was suffering from a lack of space and the fonds of the courts and external federal services were transferred to the State Archives in Beveren. In 1994, plans were put forward to expand the State Archives in Antwerp, but work on building a new wing with stores and offices only began at the end of 2007. As the extension work at the State Archives in Antwerp is still ongoing, these archives merged with the State Archives in Beveren on 1 May 2014. Once the work in Antwerp is completed, the State Archives in Antwerp will return to the Door Verstraeteplaats. The State Archives in Beveren will then operate again as an intermediate repository for the entire Flemish region.","buildings":"Initially, the State Archives were housed in a small, rented house in the old city centre, namely in the Hofstraat. In July 1897, the National Archives in Antwerp opened their doors. In 1906, the State Archives moved to the Door Verstraeteplaats in the new city district 'Zurenborg'. The Antwerp architect Eugène Geefs (1854-1925) designed a monumental and rather functional building in neo-Renaissance style at that location. The facade was crowned with two picturesque turrets and a bronze statue of the history muse Clio. The new building could accommodate 2.67 kilometres of archives.\r\n\r\nThe design of the archive building was progressive for its time. Especially the preventive and structural safety measures against fire, frost and water - together with sunlight the most important enemies of archive documents - were innovative. To prevent fire from spreading, the archive depot was compartmentalised. The archive rooms were separated from each other by thick reinforced concrete walls and fireproof metal doors. The stairwells were placed outside the archive depots and the smaller metal spiral staircases in the corner towers were equipped with metal vault doors. Moisture problems were prevented by providing preventive ventilation holes in the outer walls. The innovative concept gained international acclaim at the beginning of the 20th century. \"An enviable archive building\", \"un modèle du genre\" and \"the most instructive and a model for us\" were some of the many accolades.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the 1930s, the archive warehouse became completely full. Spurred on by the German Archivschutz, a new wing was added on Bosduifstraat in 1942. The capacity of the warehouse doubled. But the rapid growth of archive files in the second half of the last century meant there was a serious shortage of space again. Therefore, from 1994 onwards, the Government Buildings Agency and the State Archives made plans for a substantial extension and renovation of the building. It was only in the autumn of 2007 that the far-reaching work began. The files and the staff of the State Archives in Antwerp were temporarily moved to the State Archives in Beveren. In 2012, the structural work was completed, but a protracted dispute between the Public Buildings Administration and the main contractor meant that the second phase (finishing, HVAC and electricity) was postponed for several years. In 2018, things started to move again. The building concept was updated and the finishing phase was put out to public tender for a second time. In October 2020, the renovated building was delivered and in December of that year it was officially handed over to the State Archives.\r\n\r\nThe renovated building has ultimately become a beautiful symbiosis between the belle époque grandeur of the early 20th century and the functionality, comfort and technology of the 21st century. By using large areas of glass in the public areas, the interior looks transparent, open and fresh. The former courtyard garden made way for a reading room with 40 comfortable seats, bathed in a sea of light. The glass dome is strongly reminiscent of that in the Flemish Parliament building in Brussels. The authentic elements were restored as much as possible: from the white mosaic floor with the Belgian tricolore border in the hall, the monumental wooden front door with bronze fittings, the stately wrought-iron hall staircase, the high ceilings in the offices ... up to the original concrete archive racks and fireproof iron filing doors. A conscious decision was made to harmoniously integrate the original furniture (dating from the beginning of the 20th century) into the current interior.\r\n\r\nPartly as a result of the long drag of the building work, the State Archives of Antwerp merged with the State Archives of Beveren on 1 May 2014 to form one administrative service. From 2014 to 2020, the Antwerp-Beveren State Archives operated exclusively from Beveren. Between December 2020 and February 2021, more than 11 running km of archives were moved from the depot in Beveren to the renovated State Archives in Antwerp. In April 2021, the renovated archive building opened its doors and the headquarters of the Antwerp-Beveren State Archives were moved to the Door Verstraeteplaats. The State Archives in Beveren function as the auxiliary depot of Antwerp from now on.","holdings":"The archives held at the State Archives in Antwerp-Beveren can be subdivided into two main geographical areas.

The former courtyard garden made way for a reading room with 40 comfortable seats, bathed in a sea of light. The glass dome is strongly reminiscent of that in the Flemish Parliament building in Brussels. The authentic elements were restored as much as possible: from the white mosaic floor with the Belgian tricolore border in the hall, the monumental wooden front door with bronze fittings, the stately wrought-iron hall staircase, the high ceilings in the offices ... up to the original concrete archive racks and fireproof iron filing doors. A conscious decision was made to harmoniously integrate the original furniture (dating from the beginning of the 20th century) into the current interior.\r\n\r\nPartly as a result of the long drag of the building work, the State Archives of Antwerp merged with the State Archives of Beveren on 1 May 2014 to form one administrative service. From 2014 to 2020, the Antwerp-Beveren State Archives operated exclusively from Beveren. Between December 2020 and February 2021, more than 11 running km of archives were moved from the depot in Beveren to the renovated State Archives in Antwerp. In April 2021, the renovated archive building opened its doors and the headquarters of the Antwerp-Beveren State Archives were moved to the Door Verstraeteplaats. The State Archives in Beveren function as the auxiliary depot of Antwerp from now on.  ","holdings":"The archives held at the State Archives in Antwerp-Beveren can be subdivided into two main geographical areas.

The institution is independent from the executive and judiciary, although it carries out duties related to both branches. Its mission is to defend public order and serve the general public interest. The main task of the Public Prosecutor’s Office is to handle civil and criminal cases. In criminal cases, the Public Prosecutor’s Office is involved in the investigation and the eventual trial – from the criminal investigation (assessment of violations of the law, identifying and tracing perpetrators and witnesses, further investigation and so on) over the decision to prosecute (or to abate legal proceedings, to settle amicably etc) to the criminal prosecution in court and the supervision of the execution of the pronounced sentence. In civil cases, the Public Prosecutor’s Office may offer advice, if required to keep public order. In addition, the Public Prosecutor’s Office also supervises the proper functioning of the court system, and it is entitled to advise the political authorities. The parket van de procureur des Konings serves as public prosecution at the Courts of first instance, the Commercial Courts and the Police Courts. The procureur des Konings is assisted by a first substitute and a substitute. Today, there are 27 prosecution offices of this type in Belgium. One level above, the procureur-generaal is in charge of the Parket-Generaal (General Prosecutor’s Office) and the Auditoraat-Generaal. These offices act as public prosecutors at the Hoven van Beroep (Courts of Appeal) and the Arbeidshoven (Courts of Labour). There are five procureurs-generaal in total, assisted by first substitutes and substitutes. The highest level is composed of the College van procureurs-generaal, created in 1997. One year later, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office was added, in charge of e.g. cross-border cases and organised crime. The College van procureurs-generaal is advised by the Raad van procureurs des Konings and the Raad van arbeidsauditeurs. \r\n\r\nThe archives of the prosecution offices are of great importance for historical research. Apart from general series bearing witness, for example, to the advisory function of the Public Prosecutor’s Office, they often contain comprehensive documentation files on various aspects of Belgian society. Also interesting are the files of cases for which no further legal action was taken (‘sepodossiers’). There are also series of specific documents regarding the Occupation during the Second World War (e.g. series of received records, reports of the German authorities, notitieregisters), archives regarding the sequester policy after both world wars and others. For genealogists too, the archives of the Public Prosecutor’s Office are relevant – cfr. notably the files regarding name changes, judicial declarations of death.","conditions":"Consultation of documents less than 100 years old requires the authorisation of the Procureur-Generaal bij het Hof van Beroep of Brussels.","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[50.83701,4.35211]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"be","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-002134","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-002134/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2022-10-21T07:36:20.458Z"}},{"id":"be-002158","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Rechtbank van eerste aanleg Antwerpen - afdeling Mechelen / Parquet du Procureur du Roi  de Malines","parallelFormsOfName":["The Office of the Prosecutor of the Court of First Instance Mechelen"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Keizerstraat 20","city":"Mechelen","region":"Flanders","postalCode":"2800","country":"Belgium","countryCode":"BE","email":["afdelingsvoorzitter.rea.mechelen@just.fgov.be"],"telephone":["+32 15 28 81 11"],"fax":[],"url":["https://www.rechtbanken-tribunaux.be/nl/rechtbank-eerste-aanleg-antwerpen-afdeling-mechelen"]},"mandates":"The Office of the Prosecutor of the Court of First Instance Mechelen exercises jurisdiction over the territory of the cantons Heist-op-den-Berg, Lier, Mechelen and Willebroek.","openingTimes":"The Registry is open every workday from 8.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and from 1.30 p.m. to 4 p.m.","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[51.02869,4.4858]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"be","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-002158","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-002158/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2022-10-21T07:36:15.957Z"}},{"id":"be-002140","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Openbaar Psychiatrisch Zorgcentrum Geel","parallelFormsOfName":["Geel integrated psychiatric centre","Openbaar Psychiatrisch Ziekenhuis, Geel"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Dokter Sanodreef 4","city":"Geel","region":"Flanders","postalCode":"2440","country":"Belgium","countryCode":"BE","email":["info@opzgeel.be"],"telephone":["+32 14 57 91 11"],"fax":["+32 14 58 04 48"],"url":["https://www.opzgeel.be"]},"history":"OPZ Geel has strong roots in history. More than 700 years ago, the inhabitants of the town of Geel took people with mental problems into their homes. These were pilgrims who came to the grave of Saint Dimpna to beg for healing for their 'insanity', as their mental fragility was called at the time. Wandering and looking for something to hold on to, they were not only sheltered in the place of mercy, but their vulnerability was also accepted and they were given a place in the community. Throughout the centuries, thousands of drawn people have found a warm home and a valuable life in a caring community.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the 19th century, the foundations were laid for the expansion of the 'colony of Geel'. The first psychiatrist came to the town and the government imposed a number of rules. These provided, among other things, for the division of the town into three districts, the establishment of an infirmary with two departments (men and women) and a number of observation cells, the appointment of a chief medical officer and doctors, and the recruitment of district nurses or sectionals. The duties of the boarders were laid down, as well as the rate of the maintenance fees; also the way in which the placement of the 'sick' had to be done was described by the legislator. In the second half of the 19th century, 'the colony' was greatly expanded: several iconic buildings were erected; the care was professionalised; the number of patients in foster homes rose to more than 3000 between the two world wars.\r\n\r\nUntil today, the Geelse Gezinsverpleging (Family Care) has remained a unique form of residential care that offers a good solution for some 200 stabilised chronic patients. What is unique is the way in which the actors work together around the patient: the family that takes the patient into its heart and accepts him as a housemate, the community that supports this and gives the patient a fully-fledged place in its midst, and the OPZ Geel that provides professional support and guidance to patient and foster family. Since the beginning of the 21st century, there has also been a project whereby children are placed in care families. This form of residential care is used in a differentiated way - tailored to the needs of the child.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1980s, the Sano Clinic was established because there was a need for a psychiatric hospital in the Kempen. For two decades the Sano Clinic and the Family Nursing Service formed the two major entities of the Public Psychiatric Hospital Geel. In 2002, at the request of the Ministry of Public Health, a child and adolescent psychiatry department was set up. The OPZ Geel carried out a reorganisation into three divisions: Adults, Old Age and Youth, each with its own approach tailored to the target group. The range of care has been greatly expanded with options for full-time or part-time admission, admission and treatment units, mobile teams, outpatient consultations and guidance, day activities and day treatment, post-cure... In collaboration with partners, it also participates in other housing forms than family nursing: Beschut Wonen Kempen, PVT Salto and collaborative arrangements with residential care centres in the region.\r\n\r\nOPZ Geel is co-founder and partner of the GGZ Kempen Network. Among other things, the Network offers an answer to the demand for socialisation of care: more accessible care, quicker and more correct referrals, guidance in the patient's own environment and better coordination between care providers.","generalContext":"OPZ Geel is a public psychiatric care and knowledge centre with a second-line mission. ","administrativeStructure":"Within the framework of Better Administrative Policy, OPZ Geel was transformed into an externally independent agency (EVA) of the Flemish Government on 1 January 2007.

Since then, our organisation has been called the Public Psychiatric Care Centre Geel, or OPZ Geel for short.","holdings":"The archive and documentation centre preserves the archives of Geel family nursing since the early 19th century and the archives of OPZ Geel and its predecessor, the 'State Colony for Free Family Nursing'.

One of the forts in this defensive ring was built at Willebroek. However, as most of the land on which it was built was in fact located within the boundaries of local council area of Breendonk, the structure was eventually named Fort Breendonk.\r\n\r\nDuring the Second World War, the fort became a detention camp, the Auffanglager Breendonk, for prisoners of the Sicherheitspolizei-Sicherheitsdienst (SIPO-SD). Initially, the camp was guarded by a handful of German SS and a detachment of the Wehrmacht. In September 1941, however, the number of SS guards increased, many of whom belonged to the Wachgruppe, a Flemish SD unit. \r\n\r\nAt first, the prisoner population at Breendonk was rather diverse: it was made up of Jews, political prisoners, as well as common law prisoners and black marketeers. In 1942, when the Nazis began systematically exterminating the Jews of Europe, most Jewish prisoners at Breendonk were sent to the «SS-Sammellager» (transit camp) at the Kazerne Dossin before being deported to the extermination camps in the east. Consequently, Breendonk primarily became a camp for political prisoners and members of the Resistance. \r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1941, the number of prisoners increased to such an extent that the SS planned to transfer some of the prisoners to other concentration camps. On September 22, a first convoy of approximately one hundred prisoners left for Neuengamme near Hamburg. From then on, Breendonk became a transit camp: whenever an increase in the number of prisoners made the camp unmanageable, the SS deported a convoy of prisoners to Germany, the Netherlands, Austria or Poland. In total, 3,500 prisoners, including 48 women were subjected to the “Hell of Breendonk” by the end of the war. Around half those imprisoned in the fort did not survive the war. \r\n\r\nOn 19 August 1947, a bill was passed by the Belgian Parliament, which allowed for the creation of the Memorial of Breendonk. According to the law, the primary objective of the institution is to preserve the place with its buildings and its contents as a reminder of what happened there. \r\n\r\nA complete renovation of the exhibition area, respecting the historical site and introducing new exhibition technologies was carried out in 2003. The aim of these renovations was to ensure that the Memorial would continue transmitting its message of tolerance, respect and human rights to future generations.\r\n\r\nSince 2017, the memorial has been part of the War Heritage Institute.","buildings":"The fort was built from 1906 to 1914 and consists of unreinforced concrete buildings on a trapezoidal fort island.

The French confiscated important art treasures, which can now be seen in the Louvre, among other places. In 1798, it was decided to assemble a public collection in Ghent. This then still modest collection was for a short time housed in the St. Peter's Church, until in 1809 it was provisionally accommodated in a room of the Municipal Academy.\r\n\r\nOver the years, the basic collection changed only slightly. In 1837, the city council purchased a painting by a contemporary artist for the first time, which came from the Ghent Triennial Salon. Since then, the city continued to purchase works at salons, hence the museum's very extensive collection of 19th-century art. In 1860, the museum bought its first work by an old master.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the end of the 19th century that the collection of ancient art was greatly expanded. This was due to the foundation of the association 'The Friends of the Museum'. Fernand Scribe, chairman of the Friends of the Museum, donated his entire collection to the city in 1913. Other important donors were Georges Hulin de Loo, Tony Simon-Wolfskehl, widow Lasnitzki and Raoul De Keyser.\r\n\r\nThe spectacular growth of the collection, thanks to numerous purchases and donations, meant that a new location was soon required. In 1820, Tieleman Franciscus Suys drew up the first plan for a new museum building. It was not until 1898 that the final design and location were determined.\r\n\r\nThe collection, supplemented with loans, is opened each year through temporary exhibitions. In January 2018, the museum was discredited for exhibiting 24 loans from the Toporovski Collection whose authenticity was disputed by experts. After criticism in the press, the museum management removed the artworks, whether real or alleged, and called for research by art experts. In March 2018, director Cathérine de Zegher was dismissed from her position by the city, on suspicions of forgery surrounding the loan, because she could not provide proof that she had conducted research on the collection prior to the loan, and after it turned out that she had made false statements at the city's culture committee.\r\n\r\nIn January 2020, the exhibition 'Van Eyck, an optical revolution' started. There, 13 original works by Jan van Eyck were brought together, along with another 9 works from his studio. Due to the corona crisis, the exhibition had to be stopped prematurely. Nevertheless, 'Van Eyck, an optical revolution' did win the international Apollo Award for 'Exhibition of the year'.","records":"The museum’s archive relates to the operation of the Museum of Fine Arts Ghent as a city service and includes financial, administrative, technical and HR files. The reports of the supervisory committee (1903-2007) are especially important as this committee was the museum’s beating heart. Its members included prominent local politicians, artists and experts. Together with the curator, they charted a course for the museum. The committee reports indirectly also paint a historical picture of artistic and cultural thinking in Ghent.","buildings":"In 1898, exactly one hundred years after the museum was founded, the decision was made to build a new museum building. It is located in Citadel Park, close to the Municipal Museum of Contemporary Art. It was built between 1900 and 1904 to the design of architect Charles van Rysselberghe. He created a building with an enormous openness and spaciousness. It was conceived as a traditional art temple in neoclassical style.\r\n\r\nFor the 1913 World Fair, the museum was greatly expanded, also designed by Charles van Rysselberghe. This doubled the surface area of the museum.\r\n\r\nDuring the Second World War, the museum became a ruin and only in 1951 could the collection return to the renovated museum building. Between 2003 and 2007, the museum was again thoroughly renovated and redesigned.\r\n\r\nIn 1975, the Stedelijk Museum for Contemporary Art was founded. The collection of art after 1950, with a few exceptions, moved. In 2011, the two museums collaborated for the first time during the exhibition 'Hareng Saur, Ensor and Contemporary Art'. Soon the museum square, designed by Wim Goes and Aldrik Heirman, will be redesigned between both museums.","openingTimes":"Only by appointment.\r\nhttps://www.mskgent.be/nl/contact","conditions":"Sofie Corneillie or +32 (0)9 323 67 47\r\nVeerle Verhasselt or +32 (0)9 323 67 43\r\n\r\nVisitors should report to the administrative entrance at 28, Hofbouwlaan (at the rear of the building).","accessibility":"Visually impaired people can experience the paintings in the permanent collection with the 3D tactile plates (made of polyurethane resin).

Before that, Jews were not tolerated in the Prince-Bishopric. The Jewish community was dependent on the main synagogue in Maastricht. It came under the authority of the Central Jewish Consistory of Belgium in 1834, encompassing the communities of Limburg. In 1840 there were 23 families, or about 88 people. The community grew over the years, mainly due to the emigration of Jews from the Netherlands and Dutch Limburg, but also from Alsace, Great-Britain and the German Empire. The Communauté Israélite de Liège was officially recognised by royal decree of 7 February 1876. The community did not have a dedicated place of worship at the time; the faithful gathered in private homes. The chapel of the former Saint-Julien hospice was reassigned to become a synagogue. Due to the expansion of the community a new, larger synagogue was built. Located in the rue de la Boverie, this synagogue, designed by architect Joseph Rémont, is still in use today. It was inaugurated in 1899 and became a listed monument in 2005. The Jewish population in Liège significantly increased since the end of the 19th century, reaching 1,000 individuals in 1892, including numerous foreign students at the turn of the 20th century. Many immigrants came to work in the industrial area and notably settled in Seraing, where they established their own community, including a place of worship (oratoire) in the rue du Marais. Furthermore, the ministre officiant of Liège regularly went to Spa for the holidays, Shabbat and other religious services organised for the Jewish vacationers in this health resort. Given the success of this resort destination, he was assigned a particular ministre officiant in 1912. By 1939, the Jewish community of Liège was estimated at almost 2,560 individuals, of which 60% were of Polish origin. 733 Jews of the region lost their lives due to the persecution during the war. There were many who could be hidden and avoid deportation. The community was gradually rebuilt after the Second World War. Its activities resumed. A number of Lebanese and Syrian Jewish families came to Liège, diversifying an almost exclusively Ashkenazi community. A cultural centre was created, the Foyer israélite. In 1984 the Musée de la Communauté Israélite de Liège was founded, also known as the Musée Serge Kruglanski. The community also manages a cemetery in Eijsden (the Netherlands) as well as two Jewish plots in the municipal cemetery of Robermont.

The Royal Museum of Armed Forces and Military History was born.\r\n\r\nAfter the First World War the ensemble grew through gifts and donations by foreign governments. Leconte could also take his pick from equipment left behind by the Germans. The collections were bursting at the seams and a move to larger premises became imperative. In 1923, the Museum took possession of the north wing of the Jubilee palaces. Louis Leconte, who had left active military service, was appointed curator in chief.\r\nDuring the Second World War, the Germans occupied the Museum and the institution only reopened after the conflict. The Museum then diversified and created new departments: military history, archives and library, print room and map room. In that way, the institution’s scientific character was emphasised and concepts such as conservation, restoration and presentation become key factors.\r\n\r\nThrough the Royal Decree of June 11,1976, it became a category two federal scientific institution with three departments: Technology, Scientific Documentation and Research. Its general mission was to research, obtain, preserve, and place documents, studies, publications or objects concerning military history at the disposal of the public.\r\n\r\nNew sections are established: in 1972 the Air and Space section saw the light of day and the armoured vehicle section was opened in 1980. Six years later, the Museum welcomed the magnificent arms and armour collection, which had formerly been on display at the Hal Gate Museum. In 1996, the Navy also found safe harbour at the Museum. All forces are thus represented in the KLM-MRA’s collections. In 2004, the European Forum of Contemporary Conflicts was inaugurated in the Bordiau Hall presenting an overview of twentieth century conflicts after 1918.\r\n\r\nThe Museum not only manages the site in the Jubilee Park, but also several external museums (Trench of Death, Mount Kemmel, Bastogne Barraks, Gunfire Brasschaat) and remote storage facilities.","holdings":"The Royal Museum of Armed Forces and Military History houses the historical archives of the Ministry of Defence up till the outbreak of the Second World War (archives after this date are to be found at the Belgian Armed Forces documentation centre in Evere).\r\n\r\nThe Royal Military Museum also holds private archives relating to Belgian military history.

Until 1912 officers often exercised the job of Secretary of War, afterwards this was hardly the case. Besides the minister also the King (as commander of the army) plays a role in military decision-making, and up to the Second World War the rulers effectively exerted influence on the policy of the army. In 1920 the department was given its current name, the Ministry of Defence. The institutional history of the ministry is characterised by many large and small reorganisations, especially after the First World War (including in the 1920s and in 1950, 1963, 1974, 2000-2002). One of the reasons was the interweaving of different tasks and responsibilities and the appointment of civilians as well as soldiers, because of the ambiguity between administrative and purely military functions of the Department. With the Copernicus Reform (2000-2002) the ministry was not (yet) transformed into an FPS, though the structure is thoroughly adapted to eliminate the overlaps and intermediate levels of command, and to reduce staff. Today, making the four forces (Army, Air Force, Navy and Medical Service) with their resp. services is part of a unitary structure.

It housed 18 elderly people in a rented building on Auderghem Avenue 190. In 1878, the premises were moved to rue Bara 47. In 1900, with the financial support of Mr. Franz Philippson, the organisation could buy the land on rue de Glacière where new buildings were built and opened 12 May 1901. The institution was a legally recognised association as February 8 1923 under the name of \"retirement home for elderly Jews.\" The number of residents increased. Its purpose was \"to host and take care of Jewish elderly of both sexes of at least sixty years old who are unable to meet their needs themselves.\" It also housed people paying for these services. According to Maxime Steinberg, as the retirement home of rue de Glacière was open during the occupation, staff depended on the AJB. After the war, the home was chaired by Mr. and Mrs. Paul Philippson. At this time the home had about thirty residents but was in bad shape and had to be renovated and expanded. This was done thanks to the financial support of the JDC and the JCA, Mr. Simon and Ms. Lina Haim, Leon Maiersdorf but also the subsidies from the Jewish Material Claims Against Germany inc., the COREF and the Gustav Furweiler Foundation inc. In 1949, the home had doubled its capacity. The subsidies from JOINT reduce in 1950 to stop in June 1951. The Home is affiliated with the Central Jewish charities.

But despite numerous contacts with various museums and Jewish personalities, financial resources remained limited, as the available space. This project did not come into existence. The project was to be completely stopped during and after the war. However, a showcase devoted to Judaism was exhibited at the Museum up to 1954.

Upon taking office on 2 September 1872, the liberal mayor Leopold de Wael declared that the Atheneum should be given a proper new building. It was not until 1880, however, that the city council decided to do something about it.\r\n\r\nThe school was to be located on the Gemeenteplaats, today’s Franklin Rooseveltplein.\r\nExperts, including city architect Pieter Dens, visited similar institutions in the Netherlands, France and Germany. Dens eventually designed the building, which was inaugurated in 1884. It consists of the front half of the present complex. The first lessons took place on October 7, 1884.\r\n\r\nAs if it were predestined, the idea of liberalism, tolerance and pluralism ‘avant la lettre’ grew in the Atheneum.\r\nThe Atheneum took the lead in the appreciation of the Flemish national character. It took the lead in the Dutchification of education and became a centre where the Flemish Movement of the time could grow. But … just as the diversity of the city’s inhabitants has changed over the years, so the bastion of Flemish nationalism and liberality has evolved into a fascinating, colourful multicultural school with pupils from more than 50 nationalities.\r\n\r\nToday, mindful of its history and DNA of freedom, free enquiry and tolerance, the school advocates active pluralism and equal opportunities.","generalContext":"There are many well-known names associated with the GO! Royal Atheneum of Antwerp. Poets and writers like Paul Van Ostaijen, Lode Baekelmans and Willem Elsschot, philosophers and jurists like Leo Apostel and René Victor, artists like Eugeen Van Mieghem and Herman Selleslags, but also politicians like Louis Franck, Paul Kronacker, Albert Lilar, Frans Grootjans and the mayors Lode Craeybeckx and Frans Detiège attended our school. ","buildings":"With its impressive monastic structure, the athenaeum is a bastion of peace and inspiration for pupils, former pupils, school partners and, in a broad sense, for all Antwerp citizens.\r\n\r\nThe school also has a unique hall, Zaal AthenA.\r\nOn 16 May 2014, AthenA rose like a phoenix from its ashes after a fierce fire and a long period of renovation. The drama, the ruin left behind by the fire, is still visible. The walls are permeated with the stories that originated in AthenA’s lap. This glorious past is now the backdrop for art, science and free speech.\r\n\r\nThe impressive interior that transformed the destruction into an aesthetic masterpiece, the many histories that took place there and, above all, the world-class art that you can see there, make Zaal AthenA a must-see. The highlight is the work ‘Munich’ by Luc Tuymans.\r\n\r\nHall AthenA is open for both public and private events. The hall can be hired for a variety of events, from congresses to study days, from staff parties to business events. With its contemporary equipment, technical facilities, modern furniture and catering possibilities, AthenA pampers everyone.","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[51.22061,4.41836]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"be","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-002103","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-002103/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2022-10-14T13:05:53.759Z"}}],"links":{"first":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/search?type=Repository&limit=100&type=Repository","last":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/search?type=Repository&page=23&limit=100&type=Repository","prev":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/search?type=Repository&page=3&limit=100&type=Repository","next":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/search?type=Repository&page=5&limit=100&type=Repository"},"meta":{"total":2260,"pages":23,"facets":null}}
