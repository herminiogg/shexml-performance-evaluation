From July 1942 up to the liberation in 1944, the barrack functioned as SS-Sammellager Mecheln for Jews and Gypsies. After the end of the Second World War, the building again served its original purpose as a school for the administration of the armed forces. However, in 1975, this military institute moved, after which Kazerne Dossin fell into disuse. This is why the complex was divided into apartments in the 1980s. At the request of the Vereniging van de Joodse Weggevoerden in België- Dochters en zonen van de deportatie (VJWB) (The Association of Jewish Deportees in Belgium–daughters and sons of the deportation) and the Centraal Israëlitisch Consistorie van België(CICB) (Central Jewish Consistory of Belgium), space was made available for a museum about the period during which the barrack served as a transit camp. The Flemish Government, the Province of Antwerp and the City of Mechelen financed the purchase of Kazerne Dossin’s ground floor and the basement of the right wing. The Jewish Museum of Deportation and Resistance (JMDR) was officially inaugurated on 7 May 1995 by King Albert II. On 22 June 2001, the Flemish Government approved the basic concept which was to lead to the establishment of the renewed museum: Kazerne Dossin–Memorial, Museum and Documentation Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights. The location of Kazerne Dossin–Memorial, Museum and Documentation Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights remains remarkable. It is one of the few museums in Europe located on an historic site that directly attests to the tragedy that befell the Jews during the Second World War. Kazerne Dossin wants to first and foremost be a historical museum, but also an educational aid, a memorial and a warning lest we forget.","holdings":"In 2003, the archives of the JMDR were recognised as one of the Flemish ‘theme archives’. The Documentation Centre has received a statutory mandate to collect and centralise all information regarding the persecution of Jews and Gypsies in Belgium and Northern France. This comprises the digitizing of documents and archives which are in both public and private hands and the safekeeping of original documents and archives. The lion's share of the collection can be consulted at our Documentation Centre. Some of the key archives held by Kazerne Dossin include:\r\n\r\n**Personal documents**: The archive of Kazerne Dossin contains a broad number of collections, archives and documents of private persons who put their collections at the disposal of, or donated them to Kazerne Dossin. For the most part, these include personal documents of the pre-war, war, and post-war period in Belgium. The contents of these family and personal archives differ but their importance must not be underestimated. These archives form one of the primary sources for research at Kazerne Dossin.\r\n\r\n**Immigration Authority Files**: In 2004, the previous Minister of Interior Affairs, Patrick Dewael, gave the Jewish Museum of Deportation and Resistance, Kazerne Dossins’ predecessor, permission to digitise all the photos of deported Jews from the files of the Immigration Authorities. This effort was part of the project ‘give them a face’ , a project which continues to this very day, to give all deportees a visual representation. In 2007, a new agreement was reached for the digitisation of the complete files of all the deportees who had lived in Belgium and were deported from Malines or France. The project was continued after the transmission of the files from the Immigration Authorities to the Belgian State Archive in 2008. In 2013, Kazerne Dossin concluded the project and now possesses a copy of all the files of the deportees.\r\n\r\n**Jewish Register Belgium**The anti-Jewish decree of 28 October 1940 dictated that each Jewish man or women from the age of 15 should register in the Jewish register of the municipality where they resided. The individual forms provided the following information: surname, first name, date and place of birth, nationality, profession, religion, civil state, name of spouse and children, names of parents and grandparents, date of arrival in Belgium and addresses of residence while living there. Kazerne Dossin systematically digitised the preserved Jewish registers of different municipalities. In the first place the Jewish register of Belgium which centralised the information of the smaller Jewish registers, as well as a number of preserved local Jewish registers. The central Jewish register of Belgium received a copy of the registration forms from the local registers.\r\n\r\n**Interviews**: Kazerne Dossin owns a large collection of interviews. Many of these are complemented with files containing a variety of extra documentation. The large majority of the interviews were recorded by Johannes Blum, voluntary collaborator at Kazerne Dossin. He interviewed over 1100 deported and repatriated Jews, anti-fascists, resistance fighters, political prisoners, hidden children, Jewish refugees, their rescuers, etc. as well as the children of people from these different groups. The majority of the interviews were conducted in French, others in German, English, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Polish or Yiddish. Besides the interviews of Johannes Blum the collection includes interviews recorded by Luckas Vander Taelen, Laurence Schram, Marian Handwerker, Ward Adriaens, Frédéric Molle, Myriam Abramowicz, Steven Gaertner and Herman Van Goethem. The often old-fashioned carriers are being digitised and made accessible for research.\r\n\r\n**Historical photographs**: Kazerne Dossin holds a great number of historical, portrait, and family photographs from the pre-war, war, and post-war period (e.g. family life, associations, Jewish enterprises, Jews wearing Yellow Badges, camp survivors, commemoration after the war, reconstruction). Additionally a lot of photographs can be found in the personal archives, the files of the Immigration Authorities and in other collections.\r\n\r\n**Archives of the Association of Jews in Belgium (AJB)**: Kazerne Dossin conserves the archives of the AJB which were used after the war as evidence during the judicial investigation into the responsibility of the AJB regarding the deportations. The court dismissed the case. Max Gottschalk, leader of the Jewish community in Brussels, entrusted the archive in 1959 to the Centre National des Hautes Etudes Juives, later reformed to Institut Martin Buber. The Jewish Central Consistory of Belgium entrusted these archives to Kazerne Dossin. This extensive archive contains a treasure of information on the Jewish persecution in Belgium, social assistance to Jews, Jewish education, the deportations, etc. It also informs us about the structure and organisation of the AJB and its exchanges with the German occupying regime.\r\n","openingTimes":"**Kazerne Dossin Museum**\r\n\r\nMonday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.\r\n\r\nSaturday and Sunday 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.\r\n\r\nClosed Wednesdays\r\n\r\n**Documentation Centre Kazerne Dossin**\r\n\r\nBy appointment: Monday, Wednesday and Friday (9 am to 5 pm)\r\n\r\nOpen access: Tuesday and Thursday (9am to 5pm)\r\n","conditions":"1\\) If you would like to consult the archive or the library of Kazerne Dossin, please submit a research statement.

There is no certainty about the exact date of the foundation, because all documentation was lost during the war years. It is known that around 1885 a kind of cheder (religion class) existed, where Jewish boys received religious education.\r\n\r\nAround 1894, at the initiative of Hersch Krengel (a textile trader from Austria), a day school for boys was founded, where, in addition to general education, a full Jewish program was offered.\r\n\r\nIn 1920, this school was officially recognised by the Ministry of Education. The girls 'school was founded later, in 1936, and received official recognition in 1937. This is how the original structure of the school was created: Jesode-Hatora was exclusively for boys and Beth-Jacob was exclusively for girls.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the 1930s, many German Jews had fled to Belgium. Their children were taken care of in Jesode-Hatora, which accommodated a total of 936 students. In May 1940, many refugees left for the United States, the United Kingdom or France, so the school closed its doors for a few weeks. Shortly thereafter the lessons resumed for around 500 students.\r\n\r\nFrom December 1940 onwards, Jewish children were forbidden from attending mainstream schools so the number of pupils at Jesode-Hatora greatly increased. Meanwhile, non-Jewish teachers were also banned from teaching in Jewish schools. The teachers in question were given six months to leave the institution where they were employed.\r\n\r\nThe teachers of the Jesode-Hatora eventually remained in the school until 1942 roundup. At the time the order to commence the roundup was issued, no fewer than 500 students were confined in the school. However, by the time the raid was actually carried out, the building was completely empty. The then principal, together with his teachers, had brought the students to safety by guiding them home.\r\n\r\nThe school building itself could not be saved and was looted by the occupiers and demolished from the inside. The principal's exceptional courage is still praised to this day. He was decorated for his bravery with a medal of honor from the Holocaust Museum Yad Vashem in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the Second World War, an Auschwitz survivor, Mr. Klagsbald started rebuilding the school. His reasoning was that the Holocaust survivors had a duty to breathe new life into the Jewish community.\r\nWith that ambition he gathered the remaining youngsters and Jesode-Hatora reopened in August 1945 with 17 students. Other key figures who also played a crucial role in the reconstruction of the school were Messrs Ringer, Rottenberg, Freilich, Perl, and Chief Rabbi Kreiswirth. Thanks to the efforts of these prominent men, the influx of Jewish students increased over time. \r\n\r\nJewish community life gradually returned to Antwerp and over the years other Jewish schools were reopened or founded.\r\n\r\nIn 1958, the secondary education establishments (the atheneum and the middle school) were recognised by the then Ministry of National Education and Culture. In the following years, a wing was added to Lange van Ruusboecstraat and Steenbokstraat. The school’s successful expansion continued even further with the establishment of a teacher training college which was recognised by the Ministry of National Education in 1965.\r\n\r\nToday, Jesode-Hatora Beth-Jacob has around 758 pupils, making it the largest recognised Jewish school in Flanders.","records":"Many series of this institution are ordered by school year, by class, or by family name of the student or staff member.","conditions":"Consultation requires the authorisation of the inrichtende macht (board) of the school.

The words Shomre Hadas (pronounced Shomree Haddas) are Hebrew (שומרי הדת), and mean \"Guardians of the Faith\". In standard Hebrew, it is pronounced Shomree Hadat.\r\n\r\nThe Orthodox Jewish community Shomre Hadas (‘guardians of the faith’) was created in 1920. Initially it was led by rabbi M.A. Amiel; after his nomination as Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv (1936) he was succeeded by Samuel Brodt. In 1931 Shomre Hadas merged with the Israëlitische Gemeente van Antwerpen (also known as the ‘Dutch community’) which was already recognised in 1816. In practice (and to this day) the name Shomre Hadas is commonly used instead of the more general Israëlitische Gemeente van Antwerpen. Before the war, the community had around 3,170 members. Around the community a series of religious institutions and infrastructure developed, such as ritual baths, yeshivas, smaller places of worship affiliated with the community, etc.  \r\n\r\nThe community was also the founder and driving force behind the Tachkemoni school (founded in 1920). By the end of the 1930s financial difficulties emerged. The need for resources increased as result of the solidarity with the Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria. The two main Orthodox communities Shomre Hadas and Machsike Hadass regularly clashed, i.a. regarding the supervision on shehitah. The rapprochement sought with Machsike Hadass from 1931 onwards did not lead to any result before the Second World War. After the war there was a certain merger between the two Orthodox communities (known as the Verenigde Israëlitische Gemeenten van Antwerpen), a fusion which lasted until 1958. Since then, Shomre Hadas has once again existed as a separate community.

This institute, the first of its kind in Belgium, aimed to collect the historical materials necessary for the study of social history. An enormous amount of prospecting work was undertaken at institutions and with personalities likely to deposit their archives there before the German occupiers interrupted the Institute’s activities in 1941.\r\n\r\nThe Emile Vandervelde Institute (EVI), which succeeded the INHS, officially opened on 29 September 1947 in the same premises. However, its ambitions were broader than those of its predecessor, since its aims were to \"create, promote, develop and coordinate at a national level, activities relating to the study of economic, social and cultural issues as well as all initiatives aimed at increasing workers' knowledge and organising their leisure activities, all the while being a non-profit organisation”.\r\n\r\nFrom 1948 onwards, the Institute operated as a centre for the study of the Parti socialiste belge (PSB, later the PS), with the objective of conducting research on all economic, social, financial, administrative, political, ethical and legal issues facing the Party and its organisations.\r\n\r\nApart from this political component to its operations, the library and archives continued their historical work. Gifts, deposits and acquisitions, obtained over the course of nearly three quarters of a century, have ended up creating a particularly rich and varied documentary body of social and labour history.\r\n","holdings":"The collection work undertaken by the INHS led to the major deposit of the archives and library of Louis Bertrand. Nevertheless, it was not until the 1960s that it was really possible to talk about the IEV as an archive. This shift was linked to two major events: the death of Jeanne-Emile Vandervelde (1963) and the destruction of the Maison du Peuple in Brussels (1964).\r\n\r\nAlong with Emile Vandervelde's library, Jeanne-Emile Vandervelde also transferred what had been preserved in the Vandervelde archives and as well as her own documentary materials to the Institute. As for the destruction of the Maison du Peuple, many party organizations had their headquarters and archives stored in this building. Although some of them disappeared with the building, the party secretariat fortunately took its archives with it with it when it moved to Boulevard de l'Empereur.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, a policy of regular contact with the heads of the General Secretariat as well as with personalities and organisations of the party or others belonging to the socialist movement has ensured the expansion of the collection.\r\n\r\nRecognised by the French Community in Belgium since 1995 as a private archival repository, the Institute's mission is to collect, safeguard, inventory and enhance the archives of the socialist movement in Wallonia and Brussels.\r\n\r\nThe IEV's collections are divided into three main categories: the party archives, other socialist organisations and personalities.\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed overview of the Institute's collections, see:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.iev.be/#/Archive/Les_archives/9825\r\n","openingTimes":"Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.","conditions":"All requests should be sent by email.

At the end of the 1970s, Michel Hannotte and René Deprez, two committed historians, intended to overcome the disdain classical historiography had for social history and to offset the disappearance of Wallonia’s economic and social archives. Indeed, if at the time there was already legislation in place to ensure the preservation of public archives, nothing existed for private archives. Thanks to the combined action of these two historians from Liège, an important documentary and archival body gradually took shape.\r\n  \r\nIn 1979, the IHOES collections were deposited in the municipal library of the City of Liège \"Les Chiroux\". About ten years later, after temporary installation in private premises, IHOES was transferred to the town hall of Jemeppe-sur-Meuse (Seraing), a place it still occupies today. \r\n","holdings":"The IHOES collections are rich and varied.

Gottschalk was its first president. Among its main objectives was the collection of sources, including oral sources, along the lines of the practices of the oral history department of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. As part of the project “Constitution d’archives orales relatives à la communauté juive de Belgique avant, pendant et après la guerre 1940-1945”, almost 35 interviews were collected from 1964 until 1973. A second interview campaign, titled “Campagne d’histoire orale sur l’immigration juive en Belgique au cours de l’entre-deux-guerres”, focused on communist and Zionist commitment; 45 interviews were recorded between 1980 and 1983. The CNHEJ also organised many scientific conferences, of which the proceedings were published.\r\n\r\nWilly Bok, researcher and later director of the CNHEJ, was the creator of a Record Centre tasked with collecting (like the zamler of the YIVO) a maximum of archival material produced by Jewish organisations, such as minutes of meetings, publications, invitations, leaflets, posters, etc.\r\n\r\nCertain organisations as well as individuals with responsibilities in these organisations have donated some of their archives to the CNHEJ (and later the IEJ). We note for example the archives of Paul Philippson regarding his activity within the Centrale d’Œuvres sociales juives and the Caisse de Prêts et de Crédit, as well as the archives of rabbi Israël David Berman.\r\n\r\nThe presence of archival material of the periodical Regards and minutes of meetings of its editorial board is explained by the fact that Eliyahou Reichert, librarian-documentalist of the CNHEJ since 1967, held important functions within this committee. Max Gottschalk, president of the CNHEJ and Consistory, had the archives of the Association des Juifs en Belgique stored in the Consistory buildings in the rue Joseph Dupont transferred to the CNHEJ, in order to have them ordered and used as the basis for a scientific study on the role of the AJB. The resulting publication by Betty Garfinkels, apologetic for the role of the AJB and the actions of the Belgian authorities, became highly controversial. It prevented further research on this still very sensitive question, and delayed the publication of the work titled Travail sur les archives de l’AJB written by Max Katzenelenbogen (also a CNHEJ researcher). In the early 2000s, the archives of the AJB owned by the Consistory were transferred to the Joods Museum van Verzet en Deportatie in Mechelen and were not open for research until 2002. A number of boxes nevertheless remained at the institute.\r\n\r\nIn 1970 professors of the universities of Brussels, Liège and Ghent teamed up to create the Institut Universitaire d’Études du Judaïsme Martin Buber. This institution was recognised as a public institution by royal decree of March 8, 1988 under the name of Institut d’Études du Judaïsme (IEJ). It succeeded the CNHEJ but was primarily devoted to academic education and not to the collection of sources. Today, the Institut d’Études du Judaïsme offers a specialised education in Jewish studies. It organises a two-year master’s program in Jewish history, Jewish thought and Jewish civilisation. Students can also take individual courses or obtain certificates for certain disciplines. The IEJ organises conferences, and its researchers and professors contribute to scientific research in their field of specialisation. The Institut furthermore publishes a collection of works related to Jewish studies, titled Mosaïque. The IEJ is supported by the Communauté française. It plays a key role in intercultural dialogue in French-speaking Belgium. The institute often invites leading experts as speakers on the occasion of the start or closing of the academic year, such as Emmanuel Lévinas, Robert Badinter and Ilya Prigogine. The IEJ manages a very rich library containing a mass of documentation relevant to Jewish studies. It consists of about twelve thousand works regarding Judaism, including many periodicals published in Belgium and abroad.","holdings":"The Institute's Library has a large number of books and periodicals on Jews, Judaism and Israel (in French, English, Hebrew, Yiddish, Judeo-Spanish, Dutch, German and other languages).","openingTimes":"Monday: 9:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. \r\nTuesday: 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. \r\nWednesday: 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. \r\n","conditions":"Consultation of the archive requires the authorisation of the director of the IEJ.\r\n\r\nThe Institute's library is open to the public, but users must make an appointment by telephone to consult and borrow works in its collection: +32 2 650 33 48\r\n\r\nSome books and all periodicals must be consulted on site.

Heir to the Gendarmerie museum, the centre's ambition was to be not only a museum but also a place where anyone could come and consult the corps' archives. However, due to a lack of human and financial resources, the centre had to rely mainly on a network of gendarmes who collaborated free of charge and outside their duty hours.\r\n\r\nThe \"History of Units\" team, headed by Captain Marchoul, was set up around 1978, and was charged with \"retracing the history, as vividly as possible, of all our territorial units\".\r\n\r\nThe focus is on both administrative information and stories or testimonies related to the brigades. A letter is sent to the brigade commanders, asking them to provide a list of commanders, photos of the buildings, the number of procès-verbaux written per decade since 1830, changes in staffing levels, and information on the communes within the brigades' jurisdiction. It was also requested that interesting documents be temporarily entrusted to the brigades for the time needed to ensure their reproduction.\r\nThis archival dimension gained in importance after the publication by the Ministry of National Defence of the general order of 23 May 1979, defining the attributions of its historical service. The CHTG was inspired by this order and took on the responsibility of acquiring, classifying, inventorying and preserving the units' archives. An annual activity report, with the necessary annexes, is requested from the units, but this project is not followed up by concrete measures and the reports only arrive in dribs and drabs. \r\n\r\nThe Ministry of National Defence was responsible for the organisation and general administration of the Gendarmerie. However, the Archives Act of 24 June 1955 exempted this ministry from depositing its archives in the Kingdom's General Archives. The Gendarmerie had therefore established its own rules for the careful preservation of correspondence registers and other files within the brigades. But these documents were almost systematically destroyed once their administrative usefulness had expired. In 1991, however, the Gendarmerie was demilitarised and all the competences previously managed by the Ministry of National Defence were fully transferred to the Ministry of the Interior. This demilitarisation meant that the law on archives now applied to Gendarmerie archives. \r\n\r\nBefore becoming a legal obligation for the Gendarmerie, the very idea of safeguarding historical archives was born late and was never the subject of a coherent policy at the corps level. In fact, there has never been a systematic collection of documents or registers kept by the brigades. The collection described in this inventory is therefore based on the files compiled by the CHTG staff, with the help of the brigades, in the 1970s and 1990s (lists of commanders and staff, press cuttings, postcards and photos of the buildings). It also contains the few items that were sent or recovered by the Centre during the last two decades from the Gendarmerie, such as certain registers or reports dating mainly from the 20th century. Most of the collections were essentially compiled for documentary purposes, and not as a true archive.","mandates":"The Historical Service enhances the existing collections in the museum.\r\n\r\nIt manages and carries out the inventory of the heritage (archives, uniforms, material and carriage) of the police.","holdings":"The collection has works on the history of the police services from the 18th century onwards, the lives of gendarmes and on the functioning of the police services over the years.","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[50.8267066,4.3910449]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"be","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-002132","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-002132/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2022-10-12T12:26:10.765Z"}},{"id":"be-002161","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Gemeentearchief Overpelt - Genootschap voor Geschiedenis en Volkskunde","parallelFormsOfName":["Overpelt municipality - Society for History and Folklore"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"contactPerson":"Henri Naus","streetAddress":"Zwamstraat 21","city":"Overpelt","region":"Flanders","postalCode":"3900","country":"Belgium","countryCode":"BE","email":["hna@gemeentepelt.be"],"telephone":["+32 11 94 94 00","+32 47 46 07 0 99"],"fax":[],"url":["https://www.gemeentepelt.be/verenigingen/detail/415/genootschap-voor-geschiedenis-en-volkskunde-overpelt"]},"geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[51.1964599,5.4077935]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"be","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-002161","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-002161/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2022-10-12T11:19:57.412Z"}},{"id":"be-002147","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Gemeentearchief Kwaadmechelen","parallelFormsOfName":["Municipal Archive Kwaadmechelen"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"city":"Kwaadmechelen","region":"Flanders","postalCode":"3945","country":"Belgium","countryCode":"BE","email":[],"telephone":[],"fax":[],"url":["https://search.arch.be/eac/eac-BE-A0500_102993_DUT","https://www.ham.be/"]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"be","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-002147","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-002147/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2022-10-12T10:22:36.341Z"}},{"id":"be-006104","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Gemeentearchief Kalmthout","parallelFormsOfName":["Municipal Archives of Kalmthout"],"otherFormsOfName":["GAK"],"address":{"streetAddress":"Kerkeneind 13","city":"Kalmthout","region":"Flanders","postalCode":"2920","country":"Belgium","countryCode":"BE","email":["archief@kalmthout.be"],"telephone":["+32 36 20 22 19"],"fax":[],"url":["https://kalmthout.be/dienst/archief"]},"history":"For centuries, Kalmthout was primarily an agricultural municipality.

From then on, little attention was paid to the plundering and injustice suffered by the Jewish community in Belgium.\r\n\r\nA number of Jews received compensation from Germany under the BrüG law. In the 1950s, Belgium introduced several statutes of war victims, but most people who had come to live in Belgium before the war had not been able to obtain Belgian nationality and were therefore not entitled to anything.\r\n\r\nEven today, they are excluded from the law on pensions and compensation for civilian victims of war.\r\n\r\nIt was not until after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the opening of archives in Eastern Europe that new light was shed on the appropriation and dispossession of property belonging to Jewish communities in both Western and Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nA commission was set up representing all sections of the Jewish community: National Commission of the Jewish Community of Belgium for the Restitution (N.C.J.G.B.R.) formerly operating under the name of W.J.R.O. Branch Belgium (World Jewish Restitution Organization).\r\n\r\nThe N.C.J.G.B.R. carried out its mission exclusively with the aim, on the one hand, of defending the rights of Jewish victims (deportees, children in hiding, adults in hiding) as best it could by enforcing a status for them, and on the other hand, of returning the looted amounts to their rightful owners. \r\n\r\nThe law of 15 January 1999 set up a joint (government + Jewish community) commission, known as the Buysse I Commission, to investigate the robberies. The historical investigation into the robberies led to a report, which was submitted in 2001. The day after the completion of the work of the Buysse I Commission, the government set up by law on 20 December 2001 a Commission for the compensation of members of the Jewish Community of Belgium for the goods they were robbed of during the Second World War (called the Buysse II Commission), with two members of the Jewish community appointed as observers. The commission registered 5,620 applications.\r\n\r\nEach application was thoroughly and individually investigated by the Buysse II Commission.\r\n\r\nCompared to the results obtained in other European countries, Belgium applies the highest revaluation rates. The Commission granted around €35.2 million in compensation based on criteria set by law.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the government assumed\r\n\r\n- that the non-refunded balance be paid to the Foundation of Judaism of Belgium. With the exception of a reserve that will remain at the disposal of the Buysse II Commission until the completion of the disputed cases.\r\n\r\n- That there is a derogation from the law on confiscated goods: the Jewish community is designated as the sole legal heir of goods that could not be returned to their owners or entitled parties by means of a foundation of public utility to be established by the Jewish community;\r\nthat the goods returned to their rightful owners are not subject to inheritance tax.\r\nThe total sums returned, excluding the sum paid in restitution of non-monetary gold, amount to EUR 110 million.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation wished first and foremost to support a project that fulfils a social purpose, in the broadest sense of the word, of solidarity with and support for the survivors of the Shoah. In the name of justice and to the extent of its financial possibilities, the Foundation wanted everyone who lived in Belgium during the Second World War and who from then on was discriminated against and persecuted because of belonging to the Jewish people or to the gypsies to receive 3,000 Euros as restitution, regardless of their nationality and current place of residence.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation did take into account the compensation that may already have been paid personally to the victims within the framework of the German (BrüG) or Dutch (Maror) restitution laws and/or by the Buysse II Committee.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation registered 5,175 applications. By the end of 2009, it had already responded positively to 3,807 applications for a total amount of EUR 9,418,092 and had to reject 1,330 applications.","generalContext":"The Foundation of Belgian Jewry was established to collect the balance of the oiled-up possessions of the members of the Jewish Community during the Second World War, of which no rightful claimant could be found.","holdings":"Among others contains restitution- and/or compensation-related materials: Archives of Jewish representatives in the Belgian Restitution Commission","conditions":"By appointment only","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[50.82309,4.3505]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"be","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-005594","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-005594/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2022-10-12T08:40:58.512Z"}},{"id":"be-002118","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Fondation de la Mémoire Contemporaine / Stichting voor de Eigentijdse Herinnering","parallelFormsOfName":["Foundation of Contemporary Memory"],"otherFormsOfName":["FMC-SEH"],"address":{"streetAddress":"Avenue Victoria / Victorialaan 5","city":"Brussels","region":"Brussels Capital","postalCode":"1000","country":"Belgium","countryCode":"BE","email":["info@fmc-seh.be"],"telephone":["+32 2 650 35 64","+32 2 650 67 60"],"fax":["+32 2 650 35 99"],"url":["http://fmc-seh.be/en/home-2/"]},"history":"The Contemporary Memory Foundation was established in 1994 as an Academic Institute of Research.

The two institutions work together to promote scientific research and multidisciplinary publications with a view to broadening the understanding of the historical processes which led to the coming to power of the Third Reich, to the Holocaust and Nazi terror, while also developing teaching projects intended for the various education sectors in particular, and for society in general.\r\n\r\nOn 1 April 2010 the Foundation became a Resource Center under the terms of the \"Memory\" Decree.\r\nBoth Institutions possess important archival materials, a well-stocked library, and a vast range of audiovisual documentation which is available to the public, particularly to researchers, teachers, students and the young in general.\r\n\r\nThey carry out their work and projects in a framework which is resolutely multidisciplinary, encompassing all mass crimes committed in the past or in contemporary history.","holdings":"The Auschwitz Foundation has six archive collections:\r\n\r\n- Archives of the Belgian Association of former political prisoners in Auschwitz-Birkenau and Silesian camps and prisons\r\n\r\n- Personal papers of victims of Nazi crimes and genocides\r\n\r\n- Archives of the International Auschwitz Committee (IAC)\r\n\r\n- Audio recordings of testimony by camp survivors\r\n\r\n- Audiovisual testimony by Nazi concentration and extermination camp survivors\r\n\r\n- Photo collection\r\n\r\nFurther information on these various collections can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://83.169.42.184/index.php/en/paper-material-audio-audiovisual-photo-collection","openingTimes":"Only by appointment\r\nMonday to Friday, from 09:30 to 16:00.","conditions":"Consultations are subject to an individual authorisation delivered by the Auschwitz Foundation.

","buildings":"In 1998, the vacant Sint-Felix warehouse, which is protected as a monument, was chosen as the new location for the city archives. Robbrecht and Daem architects drew up the plans for the drastic renovation, which started in 2002. On 18 August 2006, the new city archive was inaugurated in the renovated Sint-Felix warehouse and renamed the FelixArchief. In the building 18 air-conditioned archive containers were built, so that the archives could be stored in optimal conditions. The containers originally had a storage capacity of almost 34 kilometres of archives, but this was subsequently expanded to more than 38 kilometres. In order to use as much space as possible, the archive documents are no longer grouped together according to their content, but rather according to their format. A new database ensures that the archive documents can be found easily. In 2006, the reading room had 94 places and 13 microfilm machines.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, the digital repository was put into use. In 2007, the digital repository was put into use, which was put online in 2010. In 2009, the development of a scanning studio was started. Since 2010, the city archive manages the depot in the new administrative centre of the city of Den Bell. This has a storage capacity of almost 6 kilometres of archive. Also from 2010 onwards, files requested by the city services are only delivered in digital form. As of 2011, the city archive scans all incoming mail from the city and as of 2014 all incoming mail is also sorted there.

Initially, the primary mission of this new ministry was to obtain international recognition for the young Belgian kingdom. The organisational structure and missions of the ministry continued to evolve throughout the 19th century. Until the First World War, foreign policy was no real priority for the Belgian governments, as the limited number of diplomats in this period shows. This changed after the war (cfr. notably the creation of a League of Nations office within the ministry) and especially after 1945, due to the increased international cooperation (e.g. NATO, UN, European integration movement). As a consequence, the organogram and functions of the ministry were repeatedly modified. The successive constitutional reforms also had an impact on the ministry: today, the regional governments are allowed to conclude international agreements, and have certain competences regarding foreign trade. Within the administration, the secretary-general (called ‘chairman of the board of directors’ since 2000) remained very influential for a long time. Since the 1970s, the cabinet of the Minister of Foreign Affairs has become increasingly influential. Today, the ministry (which became a Federal Public Service in 2002) is composed of six directorates-general (Bilateral Affairs, Consular Affairs, Development Cooperation, European Affairs and Coordination, Legal Affairs and Multilateral Affairs and Globalisation) and five directorates and staff directorates. In addition, the FPS Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation also has a number of important functions – via its Directorate Protocol and Security – in matters regarding Belgian nobility, the National Orders, royal visits, etc. For a long time, Belgian diplomacy was almost exclusively dominated by the nobility, bourgeoisie and officers: until the First World war, diplomatic offices were highly prestigious but practically unpaid. After the Second World War the influence of the aristocracy waned rapidly. For quite some time, the diplomatic corps also predominantly consisted of French-speaking men. Since the 1960s, language use has been more balanced. In 1973, Edmonde Dever was the first woman to be appointed as ambassador.","holdings":"Two main collections are kept at this archive; the Africa Archive and the Diplomatic Archive.\r\nThe Africa archive became the property of the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs following the conclusion of an agreement on 26 August 1960 by Minister for African Affairs A. De Schryver and the government archivist E. Sabbe. That agreement was in line with a Royal Decree covering the legacy of the former Ministry of Colonial Affairs which assigned Belgium’s responsibilities for African affairs to the respective federal ministries. The Africa Archive comprises documents falling within the remit of relevant departments of the Independent State of Congo (Congo Free State) and the former Ministry of Colonies and African Affairs as well as files on similar topics concerning Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi (e.g. religious missions, the Belgian Royal Colonial Institute, annual reports from Belgian Congo, annual reports from Ruanda-Urundi, and such like). The main topics covered are politics, administration, justice, security, civil status records, economics, public works, mining, communications and telecommunications, education, religion, ethnography, history and official documents dating from 1885 to 1962.\r\n\r\nThe Diplomatic Archive contains collections of political correspondence and general publications, starting in 1830. Belgian consular and diplomatic correspondence is categorised by country and in chronological order. Most of the political correspondence up to 1934 is kept in bound volumes. Correspondence with consulates between 1832 and 1890 and between 1900 and 1910 is gathered together in separate bound volumes. \r\n\r\nAll documents of political and economic importance are listed using a continuous numbering system and divided into subjects or listed geographically or filed by name. Most of this kind of documentation, along with the development of ministerial remits, mirrors the structure of the respective ministry. \r\n\r\nAmong the holdings of the Diplomatic Archives:\r\n\r\n- General files concerning the internal politics of countries and their economic situation (files created by ministerial units, allotted remits on a geographical basis); \r\n\r\n- Specific files covering multiple aspects of bilateral and multilateral relations in which Belgium was – or still is – involved, including official VIP visits, protocol files, the problem of political refugees, wars, major conferences, border issues, etc.);\r\n\r\n- Files created owing to the diversification and growing number of European, Western or international organisations, and relating to them and to the role Belgium plays in them, including economic integration;\r\n\r\nFiles documenting the development of Belgian foreign and domestic trade, (statistics, trade agreements, treaties, the defence of Belgium’s economic interests abroad, Belgian emigration, colonisation, loans and Belgian establishments abroad) plus documents concerning problems of communication (inland, maritime or aerial navigation), since the Directorate-General of the Navy fell under the ministry’s jurisdiction until 1873). \r\n\r\n- The ministry’s archives also contain numerous files on various Belgian private companies (mainly ranging from the 19th century to the early 20th century). \r\n\r\n- Press files (collections of press cuttings on specific topics, from 1890 to 1950)\r\n\r\nMicrofilms\r\n\r\n- Category ‘P’ and category ‘B’ microfilms: documents impacting on policy (P) or trade policy (B), which have been stored on film (copies of existing paper files) to ensure their preservation (copies of existing files and/or papers) or as an alternative to archiving them in paper form. \r\nThe contents of these series of microfilms are catalogued separately and listed in the general index card file by name and subject. \r\n\r\n- Quai d’Orsay microfilms: microfilm copies of selected documents kept at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, mainly political correspondence with the French authorities about general colonial affairs and Belgian colonial affairs in particular. \r\n\r\n- ‘Nobility’ microfilms: the ministry’s Archives Department is actually only the depository of these microfilms for which the original documents belong to its Nobility Department. Microfilming handwritten documents, many of which are ancient, makes them accessible to researchers but avoids the inevitable deterioration of originals caused by repeated handling.","openingTimes":"The collections from the library of the FPS Foreign Affairs can be consulted in the Royal Library’s general reading room.\r\n\r\nMonday to Friday: from 9 am to 7 pm\r\nSaturday: from 9 am to 5 pm (not in July and August)","conditions":"All researchers must apply in writing (by post, fax or email) stating the subject, the period and the scientific aim of the research.\r\n\r\nEmbargo: Pursuant to a ministerial decree dated 27 July 1981 and subsequently confirmed by a ministerial decree on 12 December 2003, only documents that are over 30 years old may be consulted.\r\n \r\nFor documents between 30 and 50 years old, prior authorisation from the Diplomatic Committee (comprising diplomats and/or senior officials from Central Office) is required.

This donation led to the establishment of a City Library in the Town Hall. Unfortunately, it was lost in 1576, during the Fall of Antwerp, when the town hall burnt down.\r\n\r\nThanks to Christopher Plantin, the collection of the rebuilt City Library was substantially expanded. He and his successors donated a copy of every book that was printed by the Plantin publishing house to the library. In the seventeenth century, the City Library merged with the library of the Bishop’s Seminary, the collection was once again expanded. The first inventory, which dates from 1609 and which was drawn up by the then librarian Aubertus Miraeus, lists 356 works, including 32 manuscripts.\r\n\r\nAfter the librarians departure, the library laid dormant for a while.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-seventeenth century, however, the city moved its collection into one of the vacant rooms in the former Stock Exchange (Beurs). By 1700, the library returned to the town hall again. There it continued to languish for another hundred years, almost completely forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn 1805, the library opened its doors to the public for the first time. The collection of the Ecole Centrale, which mainly consisted of books from the abolished convent libraries, was added to the library’s collection soon after. In the mid-nineteenth century, the librarian Frans Hendrik Mertens laid the foundation for the library’s impressive collection of Dutch literature, which still accounts for much of the library’s collection today.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, the Volksboekerij – the present-day public library – opened alongside the City Library. Soon the town hall proved too small to accommodate all these books. In 1883, both libraries moved to the Sodality in Jezuïetenplein, which was renamed Hendrik Conscienceplein. A statue of the Flemish author was erected in the square soon after.\r\n\r\nThe library ran out of space again, however. In 1895, the public library moved to Blindestraat. The City Library now had the Sodality to itself, but the lack of space soon became evident. The building was renovated and expanded with a reading room and a storage in 1936. In 1997, the library was expanded again – the last expansion to date – occupying the building block up to Korte Nieuwstraat.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the City Library was renamed Erfgoedbibliotheek Hendrik Conscience or Hendrik Conscience Heritage Library. In 2011, the Government of Flanders formally recognised its status of heritage library. Since 2008, the library is also a partner library of the Flanders Heritage Library.","buildings":"The building and the collection both are considered Flemish heritage. \r\nThe Nottebohm Room is one of the best-kept secrets in Antwerp.

Established in 1976, KADOC is not only one of the leading cultural heritage institutions in Belgium, but also an international centre for the study of  the interaction between religion, culture and society in the 19th and 20th centuries. \r\n\r\nThe start of KADOC was extremely modest. The ten professors who regularly met from December 1974 in a side room of the refectory of the H. Geestcollege, could rely on little more than on their own enthusiasm, perseverance, occasional pats on the back, and in the best case the promise of \"moral\" support. Material and financial assistance was only promised at a later stage and only bit by bit. To achieve this, decisive arguments had to be put forward.\r\n\r\nFortunately there were strong arguments for the establishment of KADOC.In the Netherlands, the Catholic Documentation Center (KDC) of Nijmegen University - a center founded in 1971 - demonstrated the stimulating influence that a well-developed documentation center could exert on scientific research on the historical and current development of the Catholic community. The need for the establishment of an analogue center in Belgium proved all the more acute because the 'documentary patrimony' of the Catholic 'midfield' in the country was threatened by the shifts in Catholic organization after Vatican II.\r\n\r\nConcern for the safeguard of the documentary heritage of the Catholic community and concern for the development of high-quality research in an important field of the human sciences met and led to a collaboration between the academic world, the Catholic organization and the ecclesiastical authorities.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the project required thorough consultation (and therefore time). A steering committee, consisting of professors from four faculties within the humanities, was able to secure the support of the Flemish bishops and the most important Catholic organisations for the initiative. On 7 July 1976, the academic authorities gave their approval for the establishment of a centre, which at a later stage would be supported by all faculties within the faculty of human sciences.\r\n\r\nThe Centre was initially called KDOC (Documentation and Research Centre for Religion, Culture and Society) in order to distinguish it from the Nijmegen KDC and to make it clear that the \"O\" (for *onderzoek* in Dutch, which stands for 'research') in the name referred to the research function, which was of great importance in the overall set-up of the Centre. Another difference with the KDC was that the contribution of the Catholic organisation was more substantial in the Leuven institution. This would later be renamed KADOC, an acronym that was easier to pronounce.\r\n\r\nAfter the approval of the academic authorities had been obtained, it took another two years before the KADOC could open its doors to the public in October 1978.\r\n\r\nThe Centre first moved into the former library of the Faculty of Theology at the Maria Theresa College. In 1981, it was housed in the attic of the central university library, which had become vacant after the departure of the UCL from Leuven. Finally, in 1990 it would move to its current site, the former monastery of the Friars Minor in the Vlamingenstraat. \r\n\r\nThe successive relocation operations indicate that the KADOC had grown considerably over the years. In the first ten years of its existence, the Center devoted its main attention to the acquiring and processing documentation. The Centre's collections were comprised of three categories: archive, library and audio-visual material, including not only the historical but also the contemporary documentation of Catholic organizations and prominent figures. The Center committed itself to valorising this documentation for the benefit of the research world, the media sector and the wider community. This was achieved through rapid access (inventory), the organization of exhibitions and various forms of research services.\r\n\r\nThe structural approach of KADOC was quickly adopted in Flanders.The AMSAB (Archive and Museum of the Socialist Workers' Movement) was established in 1980, the Liberal Archive in 1982 and the Archives and Documentation Center of Flemish Nationalism in 1984. Very quickly, an understanding was established between these centers, which are committed to preserving and valorising the documentary heritage of civil society in Flanders. The political authorities, both at the provincial, Flemish and national level, gradually recognised the usefulness of these centres, which played a complementary to the public archives and they started to provide them financial support. Of great importance was the decree that was passed in the Flemish Parliament on 27 June 1985. This decree entailed official recognition of the four aforementioned private-law documentation centers and awarded them a recurring subsidy. The financing provided was rather modest, but it nevertheless gave the centers a more solid material basis.","holdings":"The KADOC preserves and discloses an impressive collection of archives, data, and heritage dating back to the second half of the 18th century that has emerged from the interplay between religion, culture and society in a Belgian, European and global context. In 2016, KADOC heritage collections contained 32 kilometres of archival units, 322,000 books, and 1,000 periodicals. These KADOC collections have an important European and even global dimension: they document interactions between Europe and the Americas, Asia and Africa that were intermediated by missionaries, political movements, churches, NGOs and migrants, and have shaped the world we live in. Political and social developments such as the development of civil society, the welfare state, democratization, European integration, and secularization are documented in the collections of political movements and politicians with a European/international profile, trade unions, NGOs, and religious congregations. KADOC stimulates international research in its collections by organizing international conferences, by launching networks with European universities and partner-institutions, by publishing innovative studies, and by hosting junior and senior researchers from across the world.","openingTimes":"KADOC is open on weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and on Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.\r\n\r\nKADOC's **reading room** is open from Monday to Thursday.

More than 125 years later, the registered office is still located at this address, but since 1992, however, in the legal form of a cooperative company with limited liability. \r\n\r\nThe stock exchange premises and the offices of the Diamond Club were officially inaugurated in 1894, in the presence of Jan Van Rijswijck, the then mayor of Antwerp.\r\n\r\nAfter a few years the building became too small and was extended into Hoveniersstraat. From 1966 to 1969 the building was almost completely replaced by a modern building. Its inauguration was also an occasion to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Diamond Club in the presence of King Baudouin.\r\n\r\nToday, more than 150 diamond firms are still based in the buildings.

Its official recognition by the Belgian State came about in 1832, via the Royal Decree of 21 May. A law of 4 March on the “temporal aspects of the faiths” stipulated the rights and duties of the recognised faiths in the kingdom. A Royal Decree of 23 February 1871 then confirmed the existence of the boards of directors of the five “synagogues” or communities that existed at the time, namely, those of Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent, Liège, and Arlon, under the aegis of the Jewish Central Consistory of Belgium. A Royal Decree of 7 February 1876, then went on to spell out the composition of the synagogues’ boards of directors and the procedures for electing their members (vote by secret ballot).\r\n\r\nEach community delegates one or more of its members to represent it in the Consistory. Together these delegates form the Consistorial Assembly, which meets several times a year. Seventeen Jewish communities are currently recognised: three in Antwerp, one in Arlon, seven in Brussels, one in Charleroi, one in Knokke, one in Liège, one in Ostend, and one in Waterloo. The Consistorial Assembly’s role is similar to that of a non-profit association’s general assembly. Decisions on daily management matters, for their part, are made by the Executive Board or “Bureau.” The Secretariat is responsible for the Consistory’s daily operation, in parallel with the executive officers.\r\n\r\nWhereas the Consistory’s role at the start was to represent and defend the temporal interests of the Jewish faith in dealing with the country’s civil authorities and to serve as the statutory speaking partner in all dealings with the State when it came to recognising the Jewish communities and appointing their religious officers, the range of matters within the Consistory’s purview has broadened greatly, especially since the end of World War II, ranging from religious observance to cultural matters with education and the media in between.This is the versatile framework within which the Consistory works, contributing to:\r\n\r\n- Jewish education through its Jewish religious education networks and support for the two university institutes of Jewish studies;\r\n\r\n- the preservation of Jewish cultural heritage through the establishment of the Jewish Museum of Belgium and Institute of Jewish Audiovisual Memory;\r\n\r\n- the study of the history of Belgian Judaism via the Contemporary Memory Foundation, which was created at the Consistory’s instigation;\r\n\r\n- remembrance of the Holocaust through the creation of Kazerne Dossin (formerly known as the Jewish Museum on Deportation and Resistance in Malines/Mechelen) and its involvement in annual events such as the commemoration in Boortmeerbeek of the attack on the 20th transport of deportees that took place April 19, 1943;\r\n\r\n- the dissemination of Jewish culture through the production of radio and television broadcasts concerning Judaism and the publication of a bilingual quarterly newsletter, *Nouvelles Consistoriales*/*Consistoriaal Nieuwsblad*;\r\n\r\n- interfaith dialogue on the highest level through its involvement in the consultative body for Christians and Jews in Belgium, the OCJB;\r\n\r\n- actions to take charge of the role of women in our country and problems of discrimination against women through the Jewish Women’s Council of Belgium, which is an active member of Belgium’s French-speaking and Flemish Women’s Councils; and\r\n\r\n- the organisation of the Jewish Heritage and Culture Days that are held as part of the annual “European Jewish Culture Day” in September.","conditions":"Consultation requires the authorisation of the president of the Central Jewish Consistory of Belgium.","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[50.83874,4.35501]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"be","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-002111","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-002111/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be"},"meta":{"subitems":12,"updated":"2022-10-10T05:26:14.269Z"}},{"id":"be-006135","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Commune d’Anderlecht / Gemeente Anderlecht","parallelFormsOfName":["Anderlecht Municipal Archives"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Veeweydestraat 100","city":"Anderlecht","region":"Brussels Capital","postalCode":"1070","country":"Belgium","countryCode":"BE","email":["archives@anderlecht.brussels"],"telephone":["+32 2 558 08 39"],"fax":[],"url":["https://www.anderlecht.be/nl/organisme/archieven"]},"history":"The name Anderlecht can be found for the first time in 1046. During the 11th century, the area consisted of the seigneuries Anderlecht and Aa and the villages Cureghem and Neerpede. The current municipality came into being as a result of the growing together of the lordships and villages. In 1394, Duchess Johanna of Brabant added Anderlecht to Brussels. It was not until the end of the Ancien Régime that it became an independent municipality.\r\n\r\nIn 1795, Anderlecht became the principal town of a canton. This canton had 11,400 inhabitants and 11 municipalities: Anderlecht, Dilbeek, Groot-Bijgaarden, Itterbeek, Jette, Laaken, Sint-Agatha-Berchem, Sint-Jans-Molenbeek, Sint-Maartens-Bodegem, Vlezenbeek and Wambeek. The canton had extensive pastures, which made it known for its rich grain production.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, it became the seat of a peace court. Due to language laws, the Dutch-speaking municipalities were removed from the canton in 1963. This meant that only the municipalities of Anderlecht and Sint-Agatha-Berchem belonged to the canton.","records":"The archives of the municipality are kept in a building of the town hall. In 2004, it was moved from the 3 cellars to a depot with mobile shelves. There was mould in the cellars, which meant that some archive documents had to be thrown away. The archive department manages the archive documents of 4 departments: the personnel department, the town planning department, the municipality's property and the reports of the municipal council and the bench of aldermen. The other departments have their own systems for organising their archives, and some have drawn up inventories that are kept in their offices. The departments keep archive documents in their offices and in the depot. The original minutes of the municipal council are kept in the town hall and the headings are in the depot. The minutes are now stored digitally, which means that copies are no longer made. They also keep files on the mayors, elected officials and aldermen. The records concerning the revenue are kept in 2 separate rooms in the attic.","holdings":"The archives of the commune of Anderlecht are kept in three different locations: in the Erasmushuis (Erasmus House), the Rijksarchief Brussel (State Archives of Brussels) and at the commune itself.\r\n\r\nPart of the commune's archives can be found in the Erasmushuis. The residence of the humanist Desiderius Erasmus became a museum in 1932 where a lot of historical material is preserved. In the first place, mainly church archives are kept there, but municipal archives transferred from Anderlecht can also be found.

Also the first religious ceremonies took place: weddings, circumcisions, bar- and bat mitzvot. The growing community moved to new premises in 1976 and acquired a warehouse located on the Avenue Kersbeek. The synagogue was inaugurated in 1979. At the same time a training school of Judaism (Talmud Torah) was set up, hosting dozens of children and adults. \r\n\r\nBeth Hillel initially had a strained relationship with and was not recognised by consistorial religious authorities. One of the main objects of controversy being the non-recognition of the Jewishness of some members of Beth Hillel, resulting in the refusal to bury certain Beth Hillel members in the plots of the two Jewish cemeteries.

France’s annexation of the episcopal principality then ensured the Jews’ presence and civil and political equality. The number of Jewish families living in Liège is thus rose from eight in 1808 to 220 in 1890. Most of these families originally came from Dutch Limburg (50%), Prussia, and Alsace-Lorraine. During this period the Jewish community answered to the Jewish community of Maastricht, which itself belonged to the Consistory of Krefeld.\r\n\r\nFormal recognition of the Jewish Community of Liège came about in 1876 with the Royal Decree of 7 February. In 1878, the community set up its headquarters in the Outre-Meuse neighborhood, where the abandoned chapel of the former Saint Julian’s Hospice, which had been turned into a grain market at the time of the French Revolution, became a synagogue. \r\nThe number families making up the community doubled in the early 20th century, especially after World War I, due to the incessant influx of immigrants fleeing the poverty and pogroms of Eastern Europe. \r\n\r\nOnly half of the community survived the Holocaust and the synagogue was profaned. A double painting of the victims’ names in Latin and Hebrew letters that hangs at the back of the synagogue recalls the memory of some of them, along with the resistance fighters and Jewish soldiers who fought against Nazi Germany. Moreover, many ornaments, stained-glass windows, and ritual objects are dedicated to them.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish community of Liège participated and continues to participate in many patriotic events and inaugurations, including the inauguration of the American cemetery and the national memorial to the Resistance. The synagogue and the Jewish Center next it continue their activities and house a range of very active institutions, such as WIZO, S.O.S.-Bienfaisance, the S.

The Province of Liège’s Almanach mentions Jewish prayer halls in the following streets:  Rue Souverain-Pont, Rue de la Régence, and Rue Pierreuse.  The City of Liège helped defray these venues’ rental costs starting in 1867.  Formal recognition of the Jewish Community of Liège came about in 1876 with the Royal Decree of February 7.  In 1878 the community set up its headquarters in the Outre-Meuse neighborhood, where the abandoned chapel of the former Saint Julian’s Hospice, which had been turned into a grain market at the time of the French Revolution, became a synagogue.  The café built on the site still bears the name “Café du Temple.“ The current synagogue, which was designed in Neo-Tuscan style by the architect Joseph Rémont, was inaugurated on August 18, 1899.  It is in Rue Léon Frédéricq, a stone’s throw away from the city’s current Convention Center, and has been listed as a noteworthy monument by the Walloon Region.  The rare documents of the time that have survived, including a guest book, show that the community consisted primarily of prominent citizens.\r\n\r\nThe building has a mikveh (ritual bath), sukkah (hut for the festival of Sukkot), and library.  In parallel, the community manages a cemetery at Eysden, in the Netherlands, and two plots next to the municipal cemetery of Robermont.","conditions":"Open only by appointment","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[50.63373,5.57607]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"be","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-006101","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-006101/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be"},"meta":{"subitems":1,"updated":"2022-10-09T21:20:36.128Z"}},{"id":"be-006100","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Communauté Israélite de Bruxelles","parallelFormsOfName":["Jewish Community of Brussels"],"otherFormsOfName":["CIB"],"address":{"contactPerson":"A.

Hartog Sommerhausen, a leading Dutch Jew and follower of the great German Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, moved to Brussels in 1817.  As the “brains” of the Jewish community, he immediately took things in hand and founded the Jewish Primary School, which the Dutch government honored with the title of “model school.” The capital of Brabant already had two Jewish cemeteries at the time.\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of Belgium’s independence (in 1830), the community’s headquarters were established in a rented house. In 1834, the Chief Rabbi Elie Carmoly inaugurated a synagogue in Rue de Bavière (today’s Rue de Dinant). The building became the Maison du Peuple (”House of the People”) in 1886.  Some forty-four years later, in 1878, Chief Rabbi Aristide Elie Astruc consecrated the new Main Synagogue of Brussels, in Rue de Régence, just two years after the Jewish Community of Brussels’s official recognition (Royal Decree of February 7, 1876). The Jewish Community of Brussels recently celebrated the 125th anniversary of the superb synagogue’s founding.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish Community of Brussels’s history, central location, and involvement within the broader Belgian Jewish community since its official recognition have contributed greatly to the fact that so many leading figures - leaders in our country’s Jewish community and in Belgian society in general - are to be found among its members past and present.","openingTimes":"Open only by appointment.","conditions":"Access requires the authorisation of the archivist of the [Jewish Museum of Belgium](https://portal.ehri-project.eu/admin/institutions/be-002122).","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[50.83874,4.35501]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"be","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-006100","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be-006100/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/be"},"meta":{"subitems":5,"updated":"2022-10-09T21:20:31.928Z"}},{"id":"be-002173","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Ministerie van Justitie.

Although propositions to create an autonomous judicial police had been made since the late 19th century, the project only gained widespread political support after the First World War, with the high crime rate during the Occupation having certainly played a role. The judicial police was under the authority and supervision of the procureurs-generaal, and was led by the procureurs des Konings of the different jurisdictions. The Commissariat Général / Commissariaat-Generaal (General Commissioner’s Office) was set up in 1936; it was in charge of the national coordination of the different brigades and of centralising information. Its missions ranged from infiltration and observation to gathering information from police informers – in other words, primarily repression of criminal offences and detection of violations of the law.\r\n\r\nThe judicial police of Brussels was by far the largest department (almost half of the total corps) and often operated in jurisdictions other than its own, due to the central role of the capital, the presence of particular forms of crime and the policy of centralisation of information from foreign and national agencies in Brussels. During the Second World War, the corps continued to function under the authority of secretary-general Gaston Schuind; due to the structurally understaffed police services of the occupier, Belgian judicial police officers were regularly called in. The corps was reinforced after the Liberation, out of fear of the left-wing of the resistance. The service remained virtually unchanged until the police reforms of 2001, when it was replaced by the Federal Police. The service had mainly repressive tasks: it investigated criminal activity, gathered evidence and brought offenders before the courts. In addition, it also monitored all kinds of political groups that potentially posed a threat to public security.","buildings":"On 31 March 2017, the Brussels State Archives closed its doors at 7 Demetskaai in Anderlecht to move to Forest.

The Grand Orient of Belgium (GOB) was created in 1833 as an umbrella organisation of Freemasonry in Belgium. The GOB is a federation for so-called “Symbolic” Freemasonry only and not of “Scottish” Freemasonry, which has 33 instead of 3 degrees, and which has been governed by the Supreme Council (Suprême Conseil, Opperraad) since 1817. Although many Belgian Freemasons were Catholics, Liberalism became predominant after the episcopal condemnation of Freemasonry (1837). The Belgian lodges played a key role in secular, anticlerical ‘Latin’ Freemasonry. The issue of allowing political discussion within the lodges, as well as the irreligious or more deistic nature of the rituals formed points of conflict. By the end of the 19th century, notably as a result of modifications in suffrage and the advent of new political ideologies, political discussion was increasingly less accepted. In 1959 the Grand Lodge of Belgium (Grande Loge de Belgique, Grootloge van België), loyal to the requirements and rituals of the United Grand Lodge of England and recognised by it between 1965-1976, seceded from the GOB. In turn, the Grand Lodge faced a split of ‘regular’ lodges in 1979. The Supreme Council (Opperraad) too was split up in several smaller federations. Since 1989 a “friendship agreement” (vriendschapsconventie) exists between the obediences of the various Symbolic lodges, in which their disagreements are recognised and accepted. Relevant for this guide is the persecution of Freemasonry by the occupier during the Second World War, because of the alleged ties between Judaism, Freemasonry and Bolshevism. To “prove” this link, the archives of the GOB were confiscated; eventually they ended up, like so many other archives, in Moscow. Several German and collaborationist organisations (including REX and the Antimaçonnieke Bond l’Épuration – De Bezem) occupied the premises of the GOB in Lakensestraat in Brussels.","generalContext":"The MADOC-CEDOM's objectives are to:\r\n\r\n- Gather documentation relating to Freemasonry, as well as subjects that fall within the scope of Freemasons' concerns (human rights, ethics, etc.).

The institution maintains close ties with the Belgian government and the Ministry of Finance, although it enjoys a high degree of autonomy due to its legal personality.","generalContext":"The National Bank holds a number of core competences: discounting and acquisition of commercial and government securities, trade in gold and silver, granting advances on gold and silver bullion and coins, redeeming securities entrusted to the bank, taking into custody of securities and receiving money on current accounts, and granting short-term advances on (state-)guaranteed values.","mandates":"The National Bank is managed by a board of administrators composed of the Governor and six Directors. Supervision is carried out by the College van Censoren, a Discontocomité and a Government Commissioner. Furthermore, the General Council (e.g. distribution of dividends and profits) and the General Assembly (e.g. election of directors and censoren, reception of the balance and the report of the Governor) also play a key role. \r\n\r\nThe institution is also exclusively authorised to issue banknotes, and it controls the mode and volume of banknote circulation. Since its creation the National Bank holds the function of state treasurer (Rijkskassier). ","administrativeStructure":"According to the Act of 5 May 1850, the institution was governed, on the one hand, by a Governor and six Directors and, on the other, subject to the supervision of a Board of Censors, a Discontrol Committee and a Government Commissioner. The statutes approved by the Royal Decree of 4 September 1850 contained a number of additional provisions and also defined the role of the General Council and the General Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of the National Bank was appointed and removed by the king. His appointment was for five years, but could be renewed indefinitely. He had to keep his residence in Brussels. The Governor chaired the Board of Directors, the General Council and the General Assembly. He had to have their decisions implemented. \r\n\r\nThe six directors were elected by the General Assembly for six years. Each year, one of the directors had to leave office on 1 January (in an order determined by drawing in 1854). Like the Governor, they were eligible for re-election and obliged to keep their residence in Brussels.\r\n\r\nTogether, the Governor and the six directors formed the Board of Directors. It ruled on all matters, subject to the exceptions provided for by law, the statutes or the internal order regulations. The Board of Directors had to close the balance sheet every year and submit it to the Board of Censors. If the latter refused to approve the balance sheet, the General Assembly had to decide.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Censors was composed of seven members, who had to appoint a treasurer and a secretary. The censors were elected by the General Assembly for a three-year term. The Board of Censors had to meet at least once a month. The censors had to examine and approve the balance sheet and vote on the expenditure budget. \r\n\r\nThe Governor, directors and censors together formed the General Council. It had to meet at least once a month to take note of the institution's situation.\r\n\r\nThe Discontrol Committee was composed of a minimum of three members appointed by the General Council and chaired by a director. It was reconstituted every six months. The Discontrol Committee was required to meet every day, except Sundays and public holidays. It examined securities and proposed to the administration the adoption of those that met the required conditions. The amendment of 1872 stipulated that the Disconto Committee would henceforth consist of two sections with a minimum of three members each and that each section would be chaired by a director.\r\n\r\nThere was also the General Meeting of all shareholders. This had to meet annually on the last Monday of February to take note of the balance sheet and to hear the Governor's report, and on the third Monday of December to elect the directors and censors. The General Assembly could also meet exceptionally when the Board of Directors deemed it necessary. This was mandatory even when the convocation was requested by the Board of Censors or by 20 shareholders or when the number of directors or censors was reduced to four. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Government Commissioner possessed the right to take note of the state of affairs at any time and to verify the documents and the cash. When he deemed it necessary, he could participate in all councils and committees and the General Assembly in an advisory capacity. The amendment to the statutes made in 1900 would provide that the Government Commissioner was henceforth also authorised to supervise the investment of the available funds of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe new internal rules of procedure promulgated in 1907 listed a Secretariat Department, a Main Treasury Department, a Discount Department, a Portfolio Department, a General Accounting Department, a General Inspection and State Cashier Department, a Closed Custody and Sovereign Funds Department, an Open Custody Department and a Notes Department.\r\n\r\nThe National Bank of Belgium built a network of agencies and discount offices, which had different legal character.\r\n\r\nThe agents were in charge of managing the national treasury and were public accountants, subject to the supervision of the Court of Audit and appointed in that function by the King on the proposal of the Board of Directors. The discount offices, in turn, were private-law associations. Over time, the agents would also take on discount orders, making them not only agents of the Treasury but also agents of the bank. The agencies were established in the main towns of the judicial districts and gradually expanded with additional branches. It also expanded its network of its own offices. Cooperation between these agencies and offices was gradually developed. The larger discount offices in Brussels, Antwerp and (until 1882) Ghent were supported by local discount committees, which had to supervise all transactions and signal any lending irregularities.\r\n\r\nFor more detailed information, see [here](https://search.arch.be/nl/zoeken-naar-archieven/zoekresultaat/ead/index/eadid/BE-A0510_001185_005493_DUT).","records":"Detailed information, see [here](https://search.arch.be/nl/zoeken-naar-archieven/zoekresultaat/ead/index/eadid/BE-A0510_001185_005493_DUT).","buildings":"The headquarters of the National Bank were located in the centre of Brussels from the time of its foundation in 1850: first in some purchased premises at the corner of Rue Royale and Rue des Apricots (today Rue de la Monnaie), from 1868 in a new building on Rue du Bois Sauvage. This building would be extended as early as 1881 with a wing on rue de Berlaimont and a wing on rue de la Bank, creating an impressive complex of buildings.","holdings":"The various archive series were kept in the premises of the various departments of the National Bank until after World War II. They moved with these departments in 1868 from the buildings at the corner of Rue Royale and Rue Apricot (today's Rue de la Monnaie) to the new building complex on Rue du Bois Sauvage. This may explain some of the gaps observed However, it is not clear whether the archives of the National Bank of Belgium were transferred to London during World War I or remained in Brussels, occupied by German troops. Nor is it known whether (part of) the archive was moved to Mont-de-Marsan in southern France for several months together with the institution's administration at the outbreak of World War II. After World War II, the archives were transferred by the various departments to the institution's newly established archives department and kept in an annex to the bank. Most of the archival documents were deposited by the National Bank of Belgium in 1963 to the General State Archives in fulfilment of the contract of 12 September 1962. As a result of this deposit, both the Kingdom's General Archives and the National Bank of Belgium's archives department drew up a brief transfer list, which lists the various series deposited by department. In addition, the archive also includes some records or series transferred at later times. Furthermore, the minutes of the Board of Directors from the period from 1 June 1909 to 23 September 1913, already mentioned in the 1962 contract but not yet transferred in practice, were not to be transferred to the State Archives until 1978. Concise transfer lists were also prepared for both these depositories.\r\n\r\nThe extent of this archive is 362 linear meters. \r\n\r\nIn this fonds we note a number of relevant series. The series of card indexes relating to various legal types of companies, kept as documentation, are relevant for economic history. See the card indexes for Personenvennootschappen met Beperkte Aansprakelijkheid (nos. 2004-2103, years 1920-1957), Naamloze Vennootschappen (nos. 2104-2156, years 1880-1957), and Coöperatieve Vennootschappen (nos. 2157-2176, years 1900-1957). The index cards refer to the information on the respective companies, published in the attachments of the Belgisch Staatsblad / Moniteur belge. The card indexes are ordered alphabetically and thematically (e.g. banks, insurance companies etc.). We also note i.a. the card index “NV’s onder Duitse controle tijdens de Tweede Wereldoorlog” (companies under German control during the Second World War) – see no. 2156.

She migrated to Belgium to pursue university studies in history at the ULB. She also obtained a degree in educational psychology, an education that would be of use during the war. As a student she was active in the Jewish student association at the ULB, before working for the secretariat of the Conseil des Associations juives de Bruxelles with Léon Kubowitzki. She married Chaïm Perelman in 1935. During the Second World War, Fela Perelman was in charge of the Jewish children excluded from public schools and grouped together in nursery schools. She entrusted these children of the Nos Petits schools to the Comité de Défense des Juifs (the first meeting of this organisation was held at the Perelman house in Uccle). These children were then hidden to avoid deportation. Fela Perelman was the president of the Secours Mutuel Juif, an organisation linked with Linke Poale Zion, at the request of Abusz Werber. After the war Fela Perelman provided relief to war orphans and was also active for the Alyat Hanoar. She became one of the main organisers of the Aliyah Bet, the clandestine immigration to Palestine from Belgium in 1946-1948, an operation that was notably covered by a front organisation created by the Perelmans, titled Jewish Refugees Welfare Society. Her house, in the rue de la Pêcherie in Uccle, developed into a kind of Israeli embassy avant la lettre. As an ardent and active Zionist, she built a large network of diplomatic, intellectual, artistic and scientific contacts. She was also heavily involved in the association les Amis belges de l’Université hébraïque de Jérusalem. Her PhD thesis in history, titled Révolution belge et la Pologne en 1830, was published in 1948. In 1967 she created, with Léo Maiersdorf, the association Solidarité avec Israël, aiming to overcome divisions and organise support for the threatened Hebrew state. The funds collected for Israel exceeded all expectations. Fela Perelman was also a writer; she notably published Le ventre et la baleine (Brussels, 1947). She died in Salt Lake City (United States) in 1991. (J.-P. Schreiber, \"Fajga Estera dite Félicie ou Fela Liwer-Perelman\", in J.-P. Schreiber, Dictionnaire biographique des Juifs de Belgique.

The museum, owned by the city of Brussels since 1811, was ceded to the newly created Belgian state according to the agreement of 31 December 1842. In 1907 the first ‘society of friends’ was created: les Amis des Musées royaux de l’État à Bruxelles, counting among its members many dignitaries and personalities of the Jewish financial and industrial elite, including baron Léon Cassel, Léon Lambert, Franz Philippson and Jules Philippson. In 1919, after the First World War, the Museum was directed by chief curator Hippolyte Fierens-Gevaert. Today, the collections of the MRBAB include over 20000 works of art.

The scientific research project \"The XX and the Libre Esthetique (1884-1914). Critical edition and digitization of the Octave Maus fund\", made it possible to launch the database in 2009 by placing online nearly 2,000 letters addressed to art critic and writer Octave Maus. After this, priority was given to the archives related to René Magritte, a major figure of painting in Belgium, and then to other significant archives and to more recent acquisitions of the AACB. The digitization of the archives is still in progress. For now the descriptive data are available only in French and Dutch.

These buildings were reduced to ruin during the bombardment of Brussels by the troops of Louis XIV in 1695, so destroying a considerable part of the administrative memory of the city.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this disaster, the City enriched its collections thanks to an acquisition policy implemented by professional historians in the 19th century to whom the City entrusted the management and the administration of the archives.\r\n\r\nThe main role of the Archives of the City of Brussels is to safeguard the documents produced by the municipal administration of the city since the Middle Ages.","buildings":"The building complex that houses the Archives of the City of Brussels is the result of successive extensions that the Jules Waucquez et Compagnie company commissioned there over several decades.

However, not much is known on the subject, other than the fact that the Jews were expelled from the town, and indeed from all of Flanders, in 1125.  Jews were apparently admitted again in the 13th century but driven out once more during the 1348-49 outbreak of the Black Death.  They did not show up again in Ghent until the 18th century, although not until the late 18th century, with the French occupation, could one truly speak of a Jewish community taking root in the town.  A score of Jewish families were living in Ghent in 1817, and they already had a synagogue.\r\n\r\nThis small community was given a plot of land for a cemetery in 1847.  While the Jewish community of Ghent was recognized officiously by the young Belgian State’s authorities in 1834, official recognition did not come about until 1876.  It was granted by the Royal Decree of February 7, 1876, as was the case for the main Jewish communities of Antwerp and Brussels and the smaller communities of Liège and Arlon.\r\n\r\nIn the first decades of the 20th century the city attracted a certain number of Jewish students from Central and Eastern Europe.  They enrolled in Ghent University, and more particularly in its Polytechnical School.  An estimated 300 Jews were thus living in Ghent on the eve of World War II.\r\n\r\nDuring the German Occupation of 1940-45 Jews were allowed to live in only four cities, namely, Brussels, Antwerp, Charleroi, and Liège.  Those who refused to submit to the Nazis’ diktat had no other choice than to go into hiding.  Upon the country’s liberation, Ghent’s Jewish community reassembled.  Its members included several dozen engineers - former students of Ghent University from the interwar period - who held leading positions in Ghent’s industries, some doctors, and several university professors.  What is more, the community was enriched by the arrival of Israeli students who became integrated in Jewish community with amazing ease.  It also hosted a number of Israeli professors on sabbatical who contributed to its cultural activities.  Then a wave of Jews from the former Soviet Union swelled the community’s ranks.\r\n\r\nThe Six Day War in the Middle East and the febrile days of the summer of 1967 mobilized the city’s Jews and sympathizers.  The result was a surge of activity around the Bloch Center.\r\n\r\nReligious services were held for some twenty years in a synagogue that was renovated along the lines of Djerba’s synagogue in a strong collective movement.  However, in 1995 this building was no longer available.  Since then, the community has been given access to a room in a Protestant center where it holds religious services and various celebrations.  At Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights, children and adults come together there in a festive mood marked by music and the distribution of presents.  The Passover seder (ritual Jewish Easter meal) is a great success each year, as are other holiday celebrations, such as Tu bi’shevat and Purim.\r\n\r\nHug Ivry Gent (the Hebrew Studies Circle) has brought Jews, Protestants, and Catholics together for Bible and Hebrew classes for more than thirty years.  Other activities, such as talks on cultural subjects and current events, are likewise organized around these weekly evening classes.  In addition, the community is asked to help fellow Jews, be they Belgian or foreign (often Israelis), hospitalized in the area and to look after patients awaiting organ transplants.\r\n\r\nFinally, the community takes pride in having erected the Michael Lustic Memorial with the help of many donors, the bishopric, and public authorities.  It is an original monument in the form of a top on which the names of Ghent’s Holocaust victims are engraved.  The commemoration of the terrible events of Kristallnacht is held in front of this memorial each year with the help of the city and patriotic organizations’ participation.  In parallel, a delegation of the Jewish community of Ghent attends the annual May 8th celebrations.\r\n\r\nIn short, this community is characterized by its openness and constructive dialogue with fellow citizens of all backgrounds.","buildings":"The archives were donated to the Jewish Museum by É.

Later on, by virtue of a French law of 5 brumaire year V (26 October 1796), all acts and documents of the Republic had to be brought together in the departmental headquarters. Until 1834, the archives were spread over the floors of three houses near the town hall. Afterwards it was transferred to the ground floor of the former Jesuit seminary in the rue des Gades (now rue Marguerite Bervoets). From 1872 to 2006, the State Archives were located on Place du Parc in Mons, in a former Visitandins monastery that was shut down in 1796 and used as a prison until 1870.\r\n\r\nOn 14 May 1940, the building of the State Archives in Mons was hit by German fire bombs that were supposed to hit the Mons railway station. Two thirds of the archives were destroyed in the flames, mainly ancien régime archives, but also handwritten inventories prepared by many generations of archivists, as well as the registers containing detailed descriptions of the archives and the secretariat files. In April 1944, the remaining archives were moved to various locations in the city to prevent Allied bombing raids from causing additional damage.\r\n\r\nThe Mons State Archives were rebuilt and opened on 29 May 1954.\r\n\r\nThe archivists have always pursued an active policy of acquisition of public and private archives in order to establish a proper State archive in Mons.\r\n\r\nBecause the archive rooms gradually became saturated and the storage conditions were inadequate, the State Archives moved in 2006 to a new building that was specifically designed for archive storage. The building has a surface area of 12,550 m² and is located on the 'Grands Prés' site, in the basement of the multifunctional Lotto Mons Expo exhibition hall. The basement was given a double wall, the first of which (the floor of the lock and the outer edge) lies in the water and supports the building like a boat, while the second (the floor slab) protects the archive from moisture.

Since 1980 the State Archives have been located in the \"Exhibition Park\". In 2019, the building was extended and the storage capacity increased to 40 linear kilometres.  \r\n\r\nOver the centuries, Luxembourg has experienced a number of territorial evolutions. Both in 1659 (Peace of the Pyrenees) and in 1815 (Congress of Vienna) and in 1839 (Treaty of London), Luxembourg had to cede part of its territory. In 1839, the Walloon part and the region of Arlon were annexed to Belgium. The archives were divided between the two countries and the documents relating to places that had become part of Belgium were transferred to Arlon.\r\n\r\nThe State Archives in Arlon were established by Royal Decree of 15 November 1849. The transferred archives were stored in the attics of the provincial administration and in the residence of Governor Steenhault (rue de Luxembourg). In 1850 the Belgian files were collected on the top floor of the new Provinciehuis.  Ten years later, the construction of a new archive repository at Place Léopold was started, where the State Archives of Arlon would remain until 1963.\r\n\r\nDuring the First World War, the State Archives were able to prevent the German troops from plundering the archives. Nevertheless, in 1985, documents stolen from the Arlon archive by a German soldier were found in Bavaria. In 1931-1932, the depot was thoroughly expanded and renovated.\r\n\r\nIn 1931-1932, the building next to the provincial government building, where the collections were kept, was extended westwards. New rooms were created and the facade was given twenty-four windows.\r\n\r\nIn June 1944 the State Archives in Arlon had to be evacuated due to circumstances. The archives were transferred to the Fourneau David estate (Châtillon) and the library was placed in the attics of the archaeological museum. On 15 November 1945, the State Archives in Arlon returned to their former location. Because of the growth of the files and an increase in the number of visitors to the reading room, the lack of space became more and more acute.\r\n\r\nIn 1960, the state archivist Etienne Sabbe obtained the establishment of an \"auxiliary depot\" in Saint-Hubert. In this way, he wanted to relieve various branches of the State Archives of the flood of documents caused by the coming into force of the Archives Act of 24 June 1955. The abbot's palace of Saint-Hubert, which offered a great deal of space, had been empty since 1956, when the prison was closed down. An agreement was signed with the Provincial Cultural Centre of Luxembourg (a non-profit organisation that was later integrated into the provincial administration to promote cultural life in the north of the province) to take over the buildings. The archives of the Marche district and the canton of Saint-Hubert were transferred from Arlon to Saint-Hubert, where an official from the State Archives supervised the collections on site. \r\n\r\nIn Arlon, meanwhile, the governor had the State Archives moved in 1963 from an annex of the Provincial Palace to a boarding school in Guirsch, a few kilometres southeast of Arlon. The reading room was accommodated in a former dentist's practice near Arlon station. This uncomfortable situation continued until March 1980, when wing A of the current building of the State Archives in Arlon - constructed by the Government Buildings Agency - opened its doors to the public after three months of relocation. The architects of the building that houses the State Archives in Arlon today had already foreseen a possible extension at the time. On each floor there is a corridor that can be connected to a future extension of the building. There is enough capacity to triple the ground surface area.\r\n\r\nThe State Archives in Saint-Hubert were opened in 1962 and served, until 2019, both to relieve other State Archives and to store the archives of the Marche district and of the canton of Saint-Hubert. However, at the end of the 1980s, the Saint-Hubert depot reached the limits of its capacity. The successive managers of the State Archives in Saint-Hubert sought and found solutions for expansion. But they were limited by the exceptional heritage value of the building and the difficulty of making it meet today's logistical requirements for archive storage. At the beginning of the 21st century, the State Archives in other provinces were gradually being equipped with buildings that could easily accommodate the archives located in Saint-Hubert.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 2012, a project to extend the State Archives in Arlon was launched. A few years later, the works started, with the Buildings Authority as the client and the Franki company as the contractor.\r\n\r\nA better public relations function and a more efficient use of budgetary means were not compatible with the maintenance of two state archives services in the province of Luxembourg, since the staff was spread over two sites, not to mention the operating costs of the buildings - mainly in terms of energy - which remained too high in relation to the storage capacity. The new wing of the State Archives in Arlon is equipped with solar panels and a heating and ventilation system based on geothermal heat. The old wing is being made completely asbestos-free and insulated. The new reading room in wing B opened to the public on 2 July 2019.","holdings":"The State Archives in Arlon hold the archives of provincial, federal and local institutions as well as individuals who were based in the province of Luxembourg.\r\n\r\nFor a broader overview of the State Archives in Arlon's holdings see:\r\n\r\n- http://www.arch.be/index.php?l=fr&m=en-pratique&r=nos-salles-de-lecture&d=arlon#archives-conservees (in French)\r\n\r\n- http://www.arch.be/index.php?l=nl&m=praktische-info&r=onze-leeszalen&d=aarlen#archives-conservees (in Dutch)","openingTimes":"From Tuesday to Friday: 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. \r\n\r\nDocuments requested in the reading room are delivered at 9:15 a.m., 10:15 a.m., 11:15 a.m., 1:15 p.m., 2:15 p.m., and 3:15 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe reading room of the State Archives in Arlon is also open on the first Saturday of the month from 9 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and from 1 p.m. until 4. p.m. Original documents may be consulted on Saturdays only after a reservation has been made before Friday 1 p.m. at the latest.\r\n\r\n**July and August**: closed between 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. and Saturdays (all day)","conditions":"Since 1 June 2018, access to the reading rooms of the State Archives is free.

Numerous documents went up in smoke: all population registers, for example, were lost.  After this disaster, the College of Aldermen took measures to ensure the continuity of services and to continue to assist citizens. A first measure concerned the protection of the archives. The valuable records were transferred to the industrial school in Bijenkorfstraat.\r\n\r\nThe city council was indeed concerned about the issue because the new town hall - which was almost identical to the old one and was designed by Maurice Van Ysendijck, son of the previous architect Jules-Jacques Van Ysendijck - was provided with rooms expressly intended for the storage of the archives of each department. Those rooms are located on the second floor of the building. It was also decided to set up a central archive department from 1915. In 1921, clear organic regulations were finally established for the Schaerbeek archives service.\r\n\r\nIn 1929, at the suggestion of councillor, historian and future chief archivist of the city of Brussels (1931-1948) Charles Pergameni, a \"historical archives\" department was created. This is the archive containing files on official ceremonies, folklore parades, inaugurations of monuments, etc. that were held on the territory of Schaerbeek.\r\n\r\nIn the 1930s, the service was gradually phased out. With the expansion of the office space, the archives housed on the second floor were pushed back into premises that were much less suitable.  Thus, numerous documents ended up in the attics of the town hall.  In successive removal operations, archive files were split up, files were lost or even destroyed. The archivist of the time, Michel de Ghelderode, was not at all interested in archives and preferred writing. The playwright was officially retired in 1946.\r\n\r\nAt the end of World War II, the archive was threatened due to the lack of paper and the recycling campaign launched to collect raw material for its production. Despite the 1955 Archives Act and the good will of the head of the department of the municipal secretariat and unofficial archivist Robert Van den Haute, the situation did not improve. When Robert Van den Haute retired in 1976, the depositories were no longer controlled by any archivist and some archive files moved to the cellars of the town hall.\r\n\r\nAnd 1995 an official archivist, Gwendoline Denhaene, was hired to straighten out the troubled state of the municipal archives.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, the municipality acquired the building that today houses much of the administrative archives. The premises, located between Rodenbachlaan and Picquartlaan and Anatole Francestraat, were formerly warehouses of CINTA (Compagnie indépendante des Tabacs (Bastos cigarettes)). Re-centralising the archive allowed the documents to be arranged more rationally and made more accessible to the public.","records":"The archives of the commune of Schaerbeek are made up of kilometres of documents. These funds and the thousands of documents they contain have been preserved for centuries, surviving the great fire of 1911, wars and perilous removals.\r\nThe oldest documents in the archives service date back to the 19th century.\r\nThe funds contain, among other things, documents relating to: works carried out on the territory of the municipality (public buildings, schools, cemeteries, expropriations, roads, etc.); of the administration (registers of the municipal councils and colleges since 1807, municipal gazettes since 1860); The organisation and functioning of the administration and its various departments (education, cleanliness, culture, population, civil status, etc.).\r\nThe municipal archives also have a large collection of photographs and postcards about Schaerbeek.","holdings":"The archives contain birth certificates, marriage certificates, divorce certificates and death certificates which are over a hundred years old.

Empress Maria Theresa, Archduchess of Austria, Queen of Hungary and Bohemia was the sovereign.\r\n\r\nIn 1769, a Literary Society was founded in Brussels under the auspices of the Count of Cobenzl, Minister Plenipotentiary of Empress Maria Theresa to Prince Charles of Lorraine, Lieutenant Governor and Captain General of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThree years later, the Literary Society received from Empress Marie-Thérèse the title of Imperial and Royal Academy of Sciences and Literature of Brussels, as well as several important privileges for the time.\r\n\r\nThe Sovereign tasked the new scholars with animating the country's intellectual life and stimulating scientific research in diverse fields.\r\n\r\nOn 21 May 1794, the Imperial and Royal Academy held its last meeting. The conquest of Belgium by France suspended the institution's activity for twenty-two years.\r\n\r\nBy Royal Decree of 17 May 1816, King William I of the Netherlands re-established it as the Royal Academy of Sciences and Literature.\r\n\r\nThe Academy survived the Revolution of 1830 intact. In December 1837, the Faculty of Literature was expanded to include a section of Moral and Political Sciences. On 1 December 1845, the Academy was reorganized by King Leopold I, who clearly divided the Science Faculty from the Literature Faculty and added the Fine Arts Faculty. Since then the Academy has been called the Royal Academy of Sciences, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium.\r\n\r\nIt was granted the state of  a civil personality by the law of 2 August 1924.\r\n\r\nThe law of 1 July 1971 regulated the use of languages; the lingua franca of the Academy is French.\r\n","records":"The archives of the Royal Academy of Belgium currently include 29,490 files. These documents are kept in the basement of the library in ideal conditions. In addition to the old archive of all documents of the Literary Society and the Imperial and Royal Academy of Sciences and Literature of Brussels, the archives also include files on general administration, different classes, iconographic collections and personal folders. \r\n\r\nThe Academy has recently adopted an ambitious policy of acquiring archives related to its history (medals, coins, paintings, etc.) and to its scholars. Moreover, the institution has recently taken possession of archives unrelated to its past. Namely, the the Froidcourt-Droixhe fonds, which contains various notes and documents accumulated by Georges de Froidcourt, a magistrate from Liège and an historian.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1845, the Library of the Royal Academy houses nearly one million documents. The Library’s collection is particularly rich and varied and it holds many rare and even unique documents. Since 2010, the Academy has been home to the prestigious Belfius Local History Library (formerly the library of the Crédit communal de Belgique). It is the most complete documentary collection on the national, regional and local history of Belgium, consisting of 45,000 books and periodicals, 77,000 postcards, 5,000 porcelain cards and hundreds of geographical maps and other Popp plans.","openingTimes":"Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\r\n\r\n**July and August**: Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.","conditions":"The Academy's reading room - l'Espace Englert - is accessible to visitors over 18 years old after registration.

To bring together all services that manage information, it was merged two years later with the informatics service to eventually form the Archives, Informatics and Digital Strategy service. Previously, the archive was managed by each service separately. From 1880 to 1920, an archivist was probably employed within the municipal administration. \r\n\r\nIncidentally, preparatory plans for the construction of a new town hall with space specifically for the archives have survived. Traces of the archivist's activities can also be found, such as folders containing a number of files. As it is today, the archive service was located at the Department of \"General Affairs\".\r\n\r\nThe service has an archive patrimony of almost 3 kilometres long, the oldest piece dating back to 1729.","records":"The Archives, Informatics and Digital Strategy Department preserves many documents received and/or created in the context of carrying out the missions of a local public administration, such as public works, health, education, etc. On the other hand, the department does not keep civil registry or population registers, nor planning permits: for these, people should contact the relevant departments directly at etatcivil.1060@stgilles.brussels, population.1060@stgilles.brussels or urbanisme.1060@stgilles.brussels. The department also keeps a number of private archives, including those of former mayors. Some of the preserved archives have already been inventoried and can be consulted online via a regularly updated website. A number of archive files are of particular interest, such as this one on the protocol visits that took place on the territory of the municipality during the period when visits by foreign personalities began upon their arrival at South Station.\r\n\r\nThe department also has a photo archive that has been almost completely digitised and a very interesting file relating to the urbanisation of the territory of Saint-Gilles, which will certainly appeal to amateurs of architectural projects from the early 20th century. Those interested in the history of both world wars can consult - subject to privacy regulations - archives on the construction of the military cemetery, passive air defence and the militia.\r\n\r\nThe department also keeps building line plans, archives on demolished buildings and files closed in connection with the organisation and construction on the territory of Saint-Gilles, in particular archives on the transport network in the municipality, major works such as the covering of the Zenne or the extension of traffic arteries, and the development of the sewage network.

The documents returned to their owner and there is no trace of them afterwards: the municipal council never knew the content of the documents.\r\n\r\n1925 : Mr Bessemans proposes to split up the archive files.\r\n\r\n1932 : Mr. Dusong became exclusively attached to the archives department for six months and managed to bring the documents together by file and to arrange them chronologically as much as possible. A report dated 6 June 1932, signed by the person responsible, shows that most of the files were arranged not too \"catholic\" and without historical interest: his task was only to bring order to the existing archives, and in the same report he points out that the archives have no value and that they could be burnt without any problem. Fortunately, this will not happen.\r\n\r\n1941 : Mr Rubens is commissioned to supervise a thesis on the preservation of Jette's archives. But at this time, rumours also begin to circulate about the formation of Greater Brussels and Mr Rubens' judicious proposals are postponed.\r\n\r\n1942 : a decree appears in September 1942, abolishing the municipalities of the Brussels agglomeration and merging them into a single territory dependent on a single administration (Greater Brussels). The services of the municipality of Jette were thus spread across the four corners of the Brussels territory, causing great disorder and confusion in the administrative files: for two long years - until the liberation of Belgium in 1944 - the archive was left to its fate as never before...\r\n\r\nA new problem surfaced at the end of World War II, when, due to paper shortages and a recycling campaign to collect raw material for paper production, the Jette municipality's archives suffered the final blow and a large part of the administrative and historical documents were destroyed or lost.  At the time, heads of departments could decide for themselves whether it was appropriate to keep or destroy documents they no longer used. As a result, there was a lot of confusion about archive management.\r\n\r\n2 October 1944: the College of Aldermen appointed Mr Genin as head of the archives department. From 1944 to 1957, he works on the systematic reorganisation of the municipal archives. The archivist is then the only person authorised to proceed with the destruction of administrative archives.\r\n\r\n25 March 1965: After reading a report by the public works department which mentioned the dangers posed by the presence of archives in the attic of the town hall, the College of Aldermen decided to move the archives to the cellars of the future municipal library.\r\n\r\n30 May 1974 : The College of Aldermen instructs Mr Monnon, who has been archivist for a number of years, to arrange for the transfer of the archives from the attic of the town hall to the cellars of the new library, as soon as the metal shelving has been installed there. In preparation for that move, the destruction of the documents \"which no longer have any significance\" is proceeding.  The condition of the attic rooms of the town hall led to the accelerated destruction of numerous documents, including some valuable items such as maps of the battle of Waterloo or deeds of sale or cession of land from before and during the French Revolution.  Today, none of it remains.","records":"The following archive files can be found in Jette (non-exhaustive list): road works, construction and maintenance of government buildings (schools, commissariat offices, swimming pools, town hall, hospital, etc.), surveys de commodo/incommodo, personnel management, meetings,…","buildings":"Today, forty years after the archive was moved, it is still in the basement of the municipal library.

In the first half of the 18th century it was transferred to the Archbishop's Palace on the Wollemarkt in Mechelen.\r\n\r\nDuring the French Revolution a number of documents were seized by the government. In the 19th century, the documents relating to East Flemish parishes that belonged to the Archdiocese of Mechelen in the *Ancien Régime* were transferred to the Diocese of Ghent. A second transfer took place after 1962. Then the archives of the old Diocese of Antwerp (1559-1801) and the archives of Antwerp parishes from the period 1801-1961 moved to the new Diocese of Antwerp. \r\n\r\nIn the interbellum period, at the initiative of the then archivist, Canon Jozef Laenen, the archive was transferred from the attics of the Archbishop's Palace to the neighboring Refugie van Sint-Truiden. It remained housed there until. in 1987. the necessity of a different repository became apparent. The archive was then housed in the former library of the Groot Seminarie (the current Diocesan Pastoral Center).

The result was a very scattered management of the archives, which were often stored in technical premises adjoining various buildings belonging to the Society. This was the case for the Personnel Department archives described here, which were moved at an unknown date to premises in the Gare de la Chapelle in Brussels (Rue des Ursulines).\r\n\r\nAs early as 1990, the AGR alerted the authorities to the storage conditions of the numerous archives stored under the Gare de la Chapelle.

In September 2016, the SNCB finally began to safeguard the archives that are the subject of this inventory: the entire collection was irradiated to ensure optimal decontamination.

The building fell in to disrepair and was purchased by the Rodney Shire Council for the historical society and restored as a museum in 1988.

During the Museum’s first years of existence, the Committee, organised exhibitions at the Myer gallery and the Tramways Board building, started to acquire objects for the Museum’s collection, and searched for premises for the museum.\r\nIn 1982, under the patronage of Sir Zelman Cowen (1919-2011), the Museum opened its own temporary premises in the disused classrooms of the Melbourne Hebrew Congregation, South Yarra. Over the next 13 years at that location, the Jewish Museum of Australia presented over forty wide-ranging exhibitions, several of which travelled nationally. The Museum attracted significant communal support and won several prestigious industry awards.\r\nIn 1992 the Jewish Museum of Australia purchased a building in Alma Road, St Kilda opposite one of Melbourne’s most beautiful synagogues, the St Kilda Hebrew Congregation. On 20 August 1995, the then Governor General, Bill Hayden, officially opened the Jewish Museum of Australia, Gandel Centre of Judaica, named in honour of the Museum’s lead benefactors, John and Pauline Gandel.","holdings":"The collection is made up of over 20,000 items that have been donated and acquired since the late 1970s.

The Centre was established under the patronage of Yad Vashem, Jerusalem and, from its humble beginnings in 1984, has grown to become an active and internationally-recognised institution dedicated to combating racism, hatred and prejudice by fostering tolerance and understanding.\r\nThe Centre was founded without large government or other grants, relying on the generous donation of time, materials and money from Holocaust survivors, their families and other supporters. Following a generous donation from the late Mina Fink in memory of  her late husband, Leo Fink, an old double-story building (a former dance school) was purchased and subsequently turned into a space suitable for housing exhibitions and a library.","records":"The JHC is an accredited museum that complies with the Museums Australia audited standards.

The artefacts collection contains material evidence of the various experiences of Jewish victims and survivors of the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nSince the JHC opened its doors in 1984, the collection has grown to nearly 18,000 artefacts. These include original documents, photographs, textiles, and artworks from the Holocaust era. These present evidence of oppression under Nazism that was experienced in ghettos, concentration, labour and death camps, hiding and false identities, resistance, migration, and acts of courage.\r\n\r\nThe JHC has more than 1,300 video testimonies as well as over 200 audio testimonies in its collection predominantly from survivors from the Polish, German, Czech, Dutch, Russian, Hungarian, Austrian, French and Greek communities of Europe who have now settled in Australia, mostly from the Melbourne community. These provide eyewitness accounts of the atrocities committed during the Holocaust, as well as glimpses into the vibrancy of pre-war Jewish life in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe JHC art collection includes works created by Holocaust survivors after the end of WWII, as witness testimony. Key pieces include Chaim Sztajer’s model of Treblinka death camp (completed and installed in 1985) and artist Walter Preisser’s series of woodcuts that illustrate his experiences in various camps throughout the war (woodblocks were carved c.1946). Sarah Saaroni created a series of terracotta and cast bronze sculptures, including one of Polish-Jewish educator Janusz Korczak surrounded by his orphans. Monumental works by professional artists include Peter Schipperheyn’s black granite Eternal Flame (1999), and Andrew Rogers’ silicon-cast bronze installation titled Pillars of Witness. These six columns depict well-known images from the Holocaust, as well as Jewish motifs.\r\n\r\nThe JHC also has a library with thousands of books covering the rise of Nazism, the Second World War and post-Holocaust analyses. Recent additions to the library include prose and books written by Melbourne survivors, copies of reports and papers presented at selected Holocaust-related conferences, journals, periodicals and booklets from other museums and research centres around the world. Journals and documents are available in a number of languages including Hebrew, Yiddish, French, English, German, Hungarian, Russian and Polish.\r\n\r\nA range of resources is available to assist people researching their family history or planning a visit to Poland, such as maps, reference material and population data. A selection of Yizkor books (commemorative books of places and people) written in memory of those who were murdered, provides descriptions of once-thriving Jewish communities of Europe that have since disappeared. Another section of the library contains volumes listing the names of ghetto inmates as well as registers of survivors compiled after the war.\r\n\r\nRare or significant original books and paper records are housed separately from the general library in environmentally controlled conditions that ensure their preservation.

Since 1938, the AJHS has provided a forum for the publication of scholarly accounts in its own journal, the Journal of the Australian Jewish Historical Society. Several meetings a year are presented for the delivery of talks and colloquia on historical matters. This website is intended to provide a speedy and accessible communication channel for our members, to give easy access to what the society is doing. Both the New South Wales and the Victorian chapters of the AJHS have been very concerned with the preservation of records, and have made representations to promote the preservation of our historic buildings and places.\r\n\r\nWithin the gamut of Australian Jewish history we include studies of Jewish activities in New Zealand and South East Asia, demographic studies, and accounts of passage to Australia. In addition, the Journal has published accounts of overseas occurrences, where there is a very strong linkage with Australian Jewish History.\r\n\r\nWe maintain close relationships with the Australian Jewish Genealogical Society. A remarkable percentage of the Australian Jewish community are either Holocaust survivors, or the children thereof. Historical studies, focussed on events of the Holocaust, as well as educational activities related to Holocaust studies, are primarily the gamut of the Holocaust Museums of Sydney and Melbourne. We have also forged beneficial ties with international bodies with similar interests to our own, learning from their experiences.\r\n\r\nThe Society is for all who share our interests. Membership includes a subscription to the Journal of the Australian Jewish Historical Society, which is published twice yearly. Members are also entitled to participate at reduced rates to the various tours of historical sites that have been organised by AJHS. These historically oriented tours have included walking tours of historical sites in the CBD and within various suburban centres such as Carlton, river cruises along the Maribyrnong River, bus trips to Ballarat, and long-weekend study tours of Tasmania.

Cramp expressed the view that the chief object of the Society should be the encouragement of individual research.[1]\r\nIn 1939, the Society published the first issue of the Australian Jewish Historical Society Journal (initially known as the Australian Jewish Historical Society, Journal and Proceedings).\r\nIn 1949, a Melbourne branch was established, which was informally known as AJHS(Vic). This branch grew and eventually incorporated. There is no national executive, with the Sydney and Melbourne Societies being financially independent. Since 1988, the two Societies have shared the production of the Journal, with the June issues being produced by the NSW Society and the November issues being produced by the Vic Society. Currently, there are two issues of the Journal each year, with occasional Special Publications.","generalContext":"The Australian Jewish Historical Society is dedicated to promoting the study of Jewry in Australia from 1788. Since its founding the Society has sought to compile and make available unique and authentic records relating to the Jewish people in Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands via the acquisition and preservation of historically significant documents and materials. Equally, the Society has pursued the conservation of places of Jewish interest and continues to foster the interchange of information through lectures, discussions and exhibitions of historical interest or value.","mandates":"The Society has been given the mandate by the NSW Jewish community to be the repository of archives of communal organisations and communal leaders. Today a growing collection of these invaluable records is housed in the Society’s secure climate controlled archive.

The material housed in the Archive consists of a variety of types including anything of an archival or ephemeral nature, which reflects the multifaceted nature of Jewish life in Australia, and its social interactions with the broader Australian community.  The Archive of Australian Judaica has been operating since July 4, 1983 within Rare Books and Special Collections at Fisher Library.\r\n\r\nWhat does it contain?\r\n\r\nArchives, partial or complete, of the major Jewish community organisations, some of which are now defunct, and papers of Jewish individuals relating to their activities within the Australian Jewish context. There are 500 shelf metres of material, collected and processed over the thirty years of the Archive's existence.\r\n\r\nPhotographs of individuals in their roles as members of community organisations or in meetings of historic community import. Photographs of places of community interest, such as synagogues and personalities, or notable events.\r\n\r\nTapes, including programmes of the Jewish Radio Hour from its inception in 1978, seminars of the Australian Association of Jewish Studies, all the reels of 'You don't have to be Jewish', and some oral histories.\r\n\r\nVideos, DVDs and CDs are collected by the Archive and include an interview with Helena Mann, a Holocaust survivor, and a video of the art exhibition of the Jewish Arts and Culture Council in 1989.\r\n\r\nBooks and Periodicals: Early in the existence of the Archive, a decision was taken that books acquired by the Archive would be housed with the regular research collections of the library and would be catalogued in the usual way. However, in situations where there is no parallel subject holding in the library, e.g. printings of the Yiddish press in Australia, the books and periodicals remain in the Archive.\r\n\r\nTheses: Researchers using the collection are encouraged to deposit their earlier theses in the Archive, also pledging a copy of any work based on archival papers consulted in the Archive.\r\n\r\nSubject files: Newspaper clippings and manuscript materials. Files are kept on such topics as Jewish education, immigration, the Freeland League, Australian Jewish communities and organisations, and on Australian Jewish individuals. Some files and photos were acquired from the Australian Jewish News offices when they moved their office to Surry Hills. Extensive subject files from 1940s to 1970s as were collected by the New South Jewish Board of Deputies, sent to Newcastle University Library but now held in the Archive.\r\n\r\nEphemera: These documents have a unique importance for social history and related disciplines. Only significant ephemera are collected where the material was thought to provide context to historical events. The Archive's ephemera is boxed alphabetically under organisation.\r\n\r\nSome of the records and minutes deposited in the Archive are of a semi-confidential nature. A few depositing organisations have asked for the semi-confidential records to be placed on restricted access and thus there is not a detailed listing of their archives on the webpage.

It was created in the year 1925 in Vilnius, the cultural center of the Jews of Central Europe. In 1928, its headquarters were established in Buenos Aires and it began to work independently from the Second World War onwards as the IWO of Vilnius was systematically looted and destroyed during the war years. IWO Foundation offers a wide range of cultural activities, including courses on Yiddish and Jewish culture, training workshops on cultural heritage topics, book and conference presentations, concerts, and much more.\r\n\r\nThe IWO Foundation has signed an agreement of cooperation with the Holocaust Museum in Buenos Aires. The purpose of this agreement is to foster activities of interest for the signatories, as well as for the general public, by strengthening the cooperative bonds and institutional coordination that contribute to the fulfilment of overlapping aspects of the statutory missions of both institutions. These aspects include: the preservation of documentation and the memory of the Shoah and the promotion of a culture of respect for Human Rights; non-discrimination; the prevention of persecution of minorities; and the fight against anti-Semitism, among others.\r\n\r\nThe IWO Foundation is also taking part in a program of microfilmation and digitisation with the United State Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Mémorial de la Shoah.

Within its collections, the public and private histories of those who preceded us coexist.\r\n\r\nThe AGN’s origins date back to the creation of the General Archive of the province of Buenos Aires in 1821. This archive was later nationalised after the federalisation of Buenos Aires. In 1957, the materials of the Archivo Gráfico de la Nación (Graphic Archive of the Nation/National Print Archive) were incorporated into the General Archive’s collections. \r\n\r\nThe AGN works under the Ministry of the Interior, Public Works and Housing and operates from Leandro N.

Moreover, it conserves the series *Registro de apoderados* of the Archive of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, as well as documentary collections of defunct private companies, such as Editorial Haynes, and of business associations, such as Centro Azucarero Argentino. Finally, it conserves the Eva Giberti and Juan Domingo Perón funds, as well as private donations.\r\n\r\nThe **Library Department** conserves approximately seventy thousand volumes of bibliographic material. Much of this material corresponds to the fonds of the General Archive of the Nation, and includes Ministerial Reports, the Official Registry and the Parliamentary Debates. It is permanently growing thanks to the entry by Legal Deposit of all the works that are published in the country, as established in Law 11.723 of Intellectual Property. In addition to the National Library and that of the Congress, it is the only Argentinean library to benefit from this acquisition system. Of the material received, only the topics related to History and Social Sciences are incorporated into its collections, so it is a highly specialized repository.\r\n\r\nThe library also holds specific bibliographic collections, such as Ernesto Celesia, José Pillado, José Biedma and Juan Domingo Perón, as well as bibliographic material from public companies.\r\n\r\nThe collection of the **Cinema, Audio and Video Documents Department** (Departamento de Documentos de Cine, Audio y Video) is made up of film archives covering historical and social events, film news, records and advertisements made by state organisations, as well as material for scientific dissemination, interviews, advertisements, political propaganda and amateur and/or domestic recordings of individuals. It is also made up of electronic documents of moving images on magnetic and digital media, including archives of national television, material from foreign news agencies and various funds of civil associations, government agencies, private producers and individuals. It also has the audio recrodings of official communiqués, radio programs, speeches, voices of personalities from the scientific, artistic and political world (conferences, interviews).\r\n\r\nThe collection dates from between 1900 and 2017. It has more than thirty thousand hours of audiovisual material.\r\n\r\nThe **Written Documents Department** (Departamento Documentos Escritos) preserves the public documentation produced both by the Hispanic bureaucracy between the sixteenth and nineteenth century, until 1810, and by the governments following the Revolution of May to 1870. In addition, it preserves documentation of private origin entered by purchase or donation.\r\n\r\nThe **Photographic Documents Department** (Departamento Documentos Fotográficos) conserves documentation from the National Executive Branch (Presidency of the Nation, ministries, public companies), private institutions (print media and civil associations), private fonds and collections. The documentation held by the department dates from between 1853 and 1986. The collection, which is made up of more than eight hundred thousand images, is drawn from different fonds such as: Caras y Caretas, Noticias Gráficas, Alerta, Tiempo Argentino, Secretaría de Información y Prensa, Crítica, and what was produced by the Archivo Gráfico de la Nación (Graphic Archive of the Nation/National Print Archive) from 1939 until 1955.\r\n\r\nThe documents of the Photographic Documents Department are organized by themes and names. In order to carry out a thematic search, documentation is accessed by an index that is divided into categories and subcategories. This index refers to the files where users can retrieve the necessary information to view the documents.

In Buenos Aires there are around 165,000 Jews, and another 25,000, in 54 communities spread throughout the country. In 1862 the Israelite Congregation of Buenos Aires was born, the first institution of the Jewish community in Argentina. Among other things, it was devoted to charity and the registration of births, marriages and deaths of the community from 1879. That same year, the congregation began to raise funds to purchase of land with the aim of creating a cemetery that would allow Jews to be buried according to tradition. On 11 February 1894, the various Jewish societies of Buenos Aires met. They created the burial society Jevrá Kedushá, which would form the basis of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA). With successive immigration flows, AMIA broadened its activities and these now encompass aspects of social, cultural, educational, political, labor, socio-sports and religious life. \r\n\r\nThe AMIA’s Mark Turkow Documentation and Information Centre on Argentine Judaism (Centro Mark Turkow) was named after a Polish Jewish immigrant who arrived in Argentina in the 1930s after fleeing from Nazism. Mark Turkow dedicated his life to work to preserving the memory of Jewish culture in general and of the local community in particular.","buildings":"The Mark Turkow Centre is located on the 4th floor of the of the AMIA headquarters and it has a reading room equipped with digital technology for reading and viewing images, sound and text.","holdings":"The Mark Turkow Centre's archive is composed of photographs, newspapers, books, magazine collections, oral and visual records of personal experiences and community events, which bear witness to Jewish life in Argentina.","openingTimes":"Monday to Thursday from 9:30 am to 5:00 pm","conditions":"Access to the Centro Mark Turkow is free and available to those interested in using the materials both in person and via remote consultation.

One of those students was Herbert Hoover, later president of the United States of America in the years 1929-1932. As a recent alumnus of Stanford (in 1919) he founded the think-tank devoted to matters of war and peace that was to lay the foundations of the present-day Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, one of the world’s leading academic research institutions with archival and library collections in this field. An overview of the institution’s collections is given in the now rather outdated guide by Charles G. Palm and Dale Reed , which is nevertheless to date the only publication of its kind; the Polish collections have been profiled by Władysław Stępniak , and his publication is the basis for the information in this very brief overview. Today, much of this information is also published on the Hoover Institution website, including inventories of the collections where such have been compiled – all the basic information is accessible and up to date online. Most  of the Poland-related materials are gathered in the “East Europe” section; the collection “Judaica” – part 3: The Holocaust is also important for our subject area. Detailed inventories of three other large collections have also been published, compiled by Mirosław Filipiak  and Z.L. Stańczyk . The core of the Polish collections is composed of the three largest deposits, now the property of the Hoover Institution Archives (HIA): those of Jan Ciechanowski (Polish ambassador in Washington, D.C.), Gen. Władysław Anders, and Minister Aleksander Zawisza, who decided to take this step following the withdrawal of recognition of the Polish Government-in-Exile by the USA and Great Britain in 1945; they were seeking a safe place in which to store these valuable archival materials, on matters including relations with the USSR.  The private status of the Hoover Institution’s collections and its geographic location were the primary arguments in favour of their decision. The publication of the extremely detailed archive searches by Stępniak and Filipiak facilitates the identification of the most important materials relating to the Jews and their vicissitudes during World War II. The key record groups have been microfilmed (in all, around a million frames) and were passed on to the AAN. Scans of the microfilms (unfortunately of mediocre quality) are now accessible on the website of the State Archives in Poland (http://szukajwarchiwach.pl). The archival materials in the HIA do not constitute the complete body of files of a given institution; they are merely part of it, though in some cases the most important part. More extensive research work is still to be done on the archival resources of the Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum in London and the AAN.

The Holocaust Project included a broad cross-section of community leaders and organizations that joined together to plan a two-day conference on the Holocaust at a time when Holocaust research and education was in its infancy and Holocaust Survivors were only beginning to tell their stories publicly. Tess believed that by studying the historic, social, moral and ethical lessons of the Holocaust, history would never be allowed to repeat itself. In 1983 a similar conference was held on Terrorism.\r\n\r\nIn 1982 the Holocaust Project leadership changed its name and moved from Valencia’s campus to offices in the Jewish Community Center in Maitland. In 1983 it became an independent 501c3 organization with the Rev. Dr. Earl Scarbeary as its  president. Tess served as the volunteer executive director, a position she held for more than 20 years.\r\n\r\nIn 1986 it opened the doors to the current Holocaust Memorial Resource & Education Center of Florida, the first Holocaust museum in the Southeast, predating the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC by 7 years.\r\n\r\nIn 1994 the state legislature mandated that Holocaust education must be taught in Florida public schools. As one of only 27 members of the Florida Department of Education’s Task Force on Holocaust Education, it is the center's responsibility to provide educational resources to a 13-county area, including instructional materials, best practices and professional development. During the 2018-19 school year over 25,000 students from area public and private schools and home school groups visited the Holocaust Center or participated in an in-school presentation by a member of the Center’s education team.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable programming to date has been the growth the highly acclaimed UpStanders: Stand Up To Bullying initiative that was launched in 2010. Since its inception, this bullying prevention program, based in Holocaust education, has impacted over 34,000 students in 89 school cohorts in 4 districts. When Mayor Dyer decided to launch his Stand Up Orlando campaign against bullying in 2014, he provided the funding to bring the UpStanders program to all 9 of Orlando’s public middle schools. This specific partnership with Mayor Dyer, OCPS and the Holocaust Center remained in place for 4 years.","generalContext":"Since the beginning the Center’s leadership has been dedicated building a respectful and inclusive community where diversity is celebrated. Tess was a visionary who fundamentally understood that it needed to be more than a history museum and memorial to Hitler’s victims. She believed that the lessons of the Holocaust provided a lens through which we could understand contemporary social and human rights issues. The Center regularly draws connections to and from the Holocaust. For instance, German exclusionary laws that prohibited Jewish children from attending school and swimming in public pools give rise to the examination of Jim Crow laws that outlawed the same. The history and lessons of the Holocaust provide a solid background to explore the immigration and refugee crisis, the genocides in Rwanda and Darfur, the human rights crisis in Syria, and the long list of “phobias” and “isms.”","mandates":"It is a nonprofit organization supported by tax-exempt donations and is open to the public free of charge.","openingTimes":"Sunday: Noon – 4pm\r\nMon. – Thurs.: 10am – 4pm\r\nFriday: 10am – 1pm\r\nSaturday: Closed","researchServices":"Diary entries: https://www.holocaustedu.org/this-week-in-history/\r\nSurvivor testimonies: https://www.holocaustedu.org/survivor-testimonies/","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.634589,-81.366215]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"us","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/us-005538","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/us-005538/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/us"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2022-09-28T14:02:39.205Z"}},{"id":"us-005582","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Holocaust Memorial Center Zekelman Family Campus","parallelFormsOfName":[],"otherFormsOfName":["HMC"],"address":{"streetAddress":"28123 Orchard Lake Road","city":"Farmington Hills","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"Michigan 48334","country":"United States","countryCode":"US","email":["info@holocaustcenter.org"],"telephone":["+1 248.553.2834 (library); +1 248.553.2400 (office)"],"fax":["+1 248.553.2433"],"url":["http://www.holocaustcenter.org/"]},"history":"The Zekelman Holocaust Center, found as the Holocaust Memorial Center (The HC), was founded by Rabbi Charles H. Rosenzveig with his fellow members of Shaarit Haplaytah. It took nearly twenty years of planning and grassroots fundraising before being ready to build. Ground was broken for the Holocaust Memorial Center on the property of the Jewish Community Campus at Maple and Drake Roads in West Bloomfield, Michigan, on December 6, 1981. Almost three years later, in October 1984, the HC was opened. When the organization outgrew its original location, it built a new museum on the grounds of the Old Orchard Theatre on Orchard Lake Road in Farmington Hills. The Center's new design received front-page coverage in the Wall Street Journal, with a headline asking, \"Should a Museum Look as Disturbing as What it Portrays?\". \r\n\r\nEach year, HMC reached more than 100,000 people through teacher trainings, virtual museum experiences, virtual programs, and in-person visits to the museum. As the Center continues to grow, so have educational outreach efforts. To aid teachers in meeting the Holocaust education mandate of Michigan Public Act 170, the teacher trainings now reach schools in nearly every county. In addition,  development of new relationships with school districts and virtual schools, understanding their needs so that every student in the state has equitable access to Holocaust education.","buildings":"It replaces an earlier Holocaust Memorial Center installed in 1981–1984 on the Jewish Community Campus at Drake and Maple roads in West Bloomfield Township. Many of the Detroit area's 96,000 Jews live in the northwest Detroit area. This memorial and education center depicts both the vibrancy of the social and cultural life of European Jews before World War II and the horror of the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nBuilt on a nine-acre site, the fifty-thousand-square-foot center resembles a Nazi death camp. The design revolves around the red brick wall harkening back to those of the Jewish ghettos and the wall encircled with cables resembling barbed and/or electrified wire of the concentration camps. The building exudes symbolism. The tall elevator shaft that pushes through the roof recalls a crematorium chimney. Sturdy brick pillars supporting the gaping entrance beneath a towerlike guard structure resemble the gateway at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Striped blue and gray metal panels that clad the exterior walls of the main block above the first story evoke the camp uniforms. Six glass pyramids glow in reference to the six million Jews exterminated. Inside, visitors descend from light into darkness and ascend again to light. Exhibits divide into thematic sections. The second floor holds the scholarship center for genealogical research and offices.\r\n\r\nThe courtyard landscape is planted with wild grasses and redwoods. Within the circular entrance drive weeds grow out of intersecting railroad tracks suggestive of the trains that crossed Europe to transport victims to the death camps.\r\n\r\nAuthor Mary E. Kremposky explains in the Construction Association of Michigan's CAM Magazine (Fall 2004) that Kenneth Neumann (1939–2007) studied images of the Holocaust in preparation for designing the museum.","openingTimes":"Sunday – Thursday: 9:30 AM – 5:00 PM\r\n\r\nFriday: 9:30 AM – 3:00 PM\r\n\r\nSaturday CLOSED\r\n\r\nLast admittance is one hour prior to close.","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[42.501854,-83.359631]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"us","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/us-005582","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/us-005582/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/us"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2022-09-28T12:24:23.857Z"}},{"id":"il-002777","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Beit Theresienstadt","parallelFormsOfName":[],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Kibbutz Givat Hayim Ihud Mobile Post","city":"Giv‘at H̱ayyim Iẖud","region":"Central District","postalCode":"D.N.

Urkundenarchiv und Registratur der Kanzlei des bis 1499 bestehenden Teilherzogtums Pfalz-Neumarkt wurden nach Fertigstellung des neuen Amberger Kanzlei- bzw. Regierungsgebäudes im Jahre 1547 nach Amberg transferiert und mit dem Archiv und der Registratur der Amberger Kanzlei vereinigt. Seit etwa 1570 oblag die Leitung von Archiv und Registratur einem Regierungsregistrator, seit dem ausgehenden 17. Jahrhundert einem Regierungsarchivar. Die Bezeichnung „Regierungsarchiv“ für Urkundenarchiv und Regierungsregistratur ist seit dem 18. Jahrhundert geläufig.\r\n\r\nBeträchtlichen Kompetenzzuwachs brachten die verwaltungsmäßigen Unterstellungen der wittelsbachisch gewordenen Landgrafschaft Leuchtenberg im Jahre 1650 und des Fürstentums Pfalz-Sulzbach im Jahre 1791 unter die Regierung in Amberg. Mit der Bildung der „Provinz Oberpfalz“ aus den Fürstentümern Obere Pfalz und Pfalz-Sulzbach sowie der Landgrafschaft Leuchtenberg im Jahre 1799 wurde das Amberger Regierungsarchiv zum „Landesarchiv“ dieser Provinz, das, zuletzt als „kgl. bayerisches Landesarchiv der Oberen Pfalz“ bezeichnet, bis 1812 bestand.\r\n\r\nNach der bayerischen Archivorganisation von 1812 wurde das oberpfälzische Landesarchiv zu einem Archivkonservatorium herabgestuft und dem Allgemeinen Reichsarchiv in München unterstellt, an das in den folgenden Jahren umfangreiche Extraditionen erfolgten. Zwischen 1820 und 1837 war es nur noch Depotregistratur der Regensburger Kreisregierung. 1841 wurde es als Archivkonservatorium wiederbegründet und 1875 wie alle bayerischen Regionalarchive in „Kgl. Kreisarchiv“ umbenannt. Es wuchs jetzt in die Funktion eines Sprengelarchivs hinein, das für die Schriftgutabgaben aller Staatsbehörden im Regierungsbezirk zuständig war.\r\n\r\nEine feste Zuständigkeit auch für die historischen Bestände erhielt das Archiv (seit 1921 „Bayerisches Staatsarchiv Amberg“, seit 1970 „Staatsarchiv Amberg“) im Rahmen der auf der Grundlage des Provenienzprinzips insbesondere seit 1974 durchgeführten gesamtbayerischen Beständebereinigung. So wurden die nach 1812 in München zentralisierten Oberpfälzer und Leuchtenberger Bestände zwischen 1986 und 2003 sukzessive wieder nach Amberg zurückgegeben (u.a. das gesamte oberpfälzische Urkundenarchiv, die Registraturbücher der Amberger und Neumarkt-Neunburger Fürstenkanzleien, die Plansammlung der Amberger Regierung, Leuchtenberger Archivalien sowie die zum größten Teil noch aus der kurpfälzischen Zeit stammenden Bestände Oberpfälzer Klöster). Weitere Bereinigungen fanden mit den Staatsarchiven Nürnberg, Bamberg, Neuburg a. d. Donau und Landshut statt und werden mit dem Bayerischen Hauptstaatsarchiv noch durchgeführt werden (so sind weitere Zugänge aus dem im Bayerischen Hauptstaatsarchiv noch nicht abschließend analysierten Bestand „Gerichtsurkunden“ betreffend die Gerichte in der Oberpfalz zu erwarten).\r\n","generalContext":"Das Staatsarchiv Amberg ist die staatliche Fachbehörde für alle Fragen des Archivwesens im Regierungsbezirk Oberpfalz.\r\n\r\nDen modernen Sprengel bildet der 1837 errichtete Regierungsbezirk Oberpfalz in seiner derzeitigen durch die Gebietsreform von 1972 geänderten Ausdehnung mit seinen Vorgängern, den in der heutigen Oberpfalz gelegenen Kreisen (seit 1808). Das Schriftgut verschiedener, am Sitz der Regierung der Oberpfalz in Regensburg ansässiger Mittelbehörden, die wie das Verwaltungsgericht Regensburg, das ehemalige Polizeipräsidium Niederbayern-Oberpfalz, die ehemalige Forstdirektion Niederbayern-Oberpfalz, die ehemalige Oberpostdirektion Regensburg sowie die ehemalige Eisenbahndirektion Regensburg für die beiden Regierungsbezirke Oberpfalz und Niederbayern zuständig waren oder sind, wird zur Gänze im Staatsarchiv Amberg archiviert.\r\n\r\nDie Zuständigkeit des Staatsarchivs für historisches Schriftgut aus der Zeit des Alten Reichs erstreckt sich auf das bis zu seinem Übergang an Kurbayern nicht zum Bayerischen, sondern zum Kurrheinischen Reichskreis gehörende Fürstentum der Oberen Pfalz einschließlich der in ihm gelegenen Klöster, ferner die Landgrafschaft Leuchtenberg, das Fürstentum Pfalz-Sulzbach, mehrere reichsunmittelbare Herrschaften sowie auf die im Nordgau gelegenen pfalz-neuburgischen Ämter, Herrschaften und Hofmarken.\r\n\r\nDie Grenzen des heutigen Regierungsbezirks werden nach Ober- bzw. Mittelfranken überschritten im Falle des Klosters Weißenohe, des Bergamts Fichtelberg, der Festung Rothenberg und der Ämter Büchenbach, Hartenstein und Schnaittach als Zugehörungen des Fürstentums der Oberen Pfalz sowie der pfalz-neuburgischen Ämter auf dem Nordgau Allersberg, Heideck und Hilpoltstein, die sämtlich in die Zuständigkeit des Staatsarchivs fallen.\r\n\r\nNicht in die Zuständigkeit des Staatsarchivs fallen das Archivgut und die Registraturen von Ämtern und Institutionen der in den heutigen Regierungsbezirk hereinragenden Hochstifte Bamberg (Stadt und Amt Vilseck: im Staatsarchiv Bamberg), Eichstätt (Stadt und Amt Berching, Kloster Plankstetten: im Staatsarchiv Nürnberg) und Regensburg (gesamte Überlieferung einschließlich der Ämter Donaustauf, Hohenburg auf dem Nordgau, Wörth a. d.

Der jährliche Zuwachs vor allem durch Abgaben der Behörden, Gerichte und sonstigen öffentlichen Stellen des Frei­staats Bayern beläuft sich auf ca. 350 Meter.","buildings":"Das 1436 erstmals erwähnte Archiv (Briefgewölbe) war im nach 1417 erbauten Amberger Schloss untergebracht. Ein weiteres Briefgewölbe besaß die Kanzlei der Neumarkter Pfalzgrafen. Als 1547 die neuerbaute Regierungskanzlei in Amberg bezogen werden konnte, vereinigte man hier beide Archive. Seit Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts wurden die Urkunden in einem Raum des Fuchssteiner Turms des Amberger Schlosses verwahrt, wo sie bis 1812 blieben. Für die bessere Unterbringung der auf den Dachböden der Regierungskanzlei gelagerten Regierungshauptregistratur wurden 1596 und 1601 zwei nördlich angrenzende Privatgebäude angekauft, mit der Regierungskanzlei baulich verbunden und zu einem „Archivum“ ausgebaut. Im Zusammenhang mit der Aufhebung der sulzbachischen Regierung 1791 und der Verbringung sulzbachischer Registraturteile nach Amberg verlagerte man Teile des Regierungsarchivs bzw. der Regierungsregistratur aus der Regierungskanzlei in das benachbarte Rent­meister­amts­gebäude. Die im 19. Jahrhundert dramatisch angewachsene Raumnot wurde 1910 durch den Bau des heutigen Archivgebäudes an der Archivstraße behoben. In den 70er-Jahren des 20. Jahrhunderts war der Belegraum des Staatsarchivs wiederum erschöpft und eine Erweiterung dringend erforderlich. Nach einer kontrovers geführten Diskussion, ob das Staatsarchiv nicht nach Regensburg als dem Sitz der Regierung und der Universität verlegt werden sollte, bestimmte ein Beschluss des Bayerischen Ministerrats vom Mai 1979 Amberg weiterhin zum Sitz des Archivs und verband damit die Zusage räumlicher Erweiterungen. Auf dieser Grundlage wurden zwischen 1984 und 1987 großzügige Um- und Erweiterungsbauten im Magazin- und Öffentlichkeitsbereich durchgeführt. Außerdem wurde in der so genannten Schlosskaserne in Sulzbach-Rosenberg eine Außenstelle eingerichtet, die zusätzliche Magazinflächen und Funktionsräume bietet.\r\n","openingTimes":"Mondays to Thursdays: 8 am to 4 pm / Fridays: 8 am to 1:30 pm / Wednesdays the reading room remains open from 4 to 6 pm "},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"de","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de-006570","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de-006570/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/de"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2022-09-26T15:01:41.553Z"}}],"links":{"first":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/search?type=Repository&limit=100&type=Repository","last":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/search?type=Repository&page=23&limit=100&type=Repository","prev":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/search?type=Repository&page=4&limit=100&type=Repository","next":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/search?type=Repository&page=6&limit=100&type=Repository"},"meta":{"total":2260,"pages":23,"facets":null}}
