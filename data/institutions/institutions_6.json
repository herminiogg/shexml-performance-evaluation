From the Nazi rise to power in Germany, and throughout World War II, there were those who documented the events as they were taking place, often under the harshest conditions. Immediately after the war, centers for documentation and the collection of testimonies were established in many places around the world, including Munich, Warsaw, Lodz, Lublin, Paris, Bratislava, Budapest and other locations. The information about what was happening in Europe began to reach the Jewish community of Eretz Israel during the war. Even before the enormity of the disaster became clear, Mordechai Shenhavi initiated a Commemorative Project for the Jews of Europe that would include an archive. The Yad Vashem Archives began its official activities in 1946, under the direction of Dr. Sarah Friedlander, who had been born in Budapest and saved on the Kasztner train.","generalContext":"An Archive dedicated to the Holocaust in Europe","holdings":"The Yad Vashem Archives holds various types of materials related to the Holocaust period, materials related to the life of the Jews in Europe between WWI and WWII and materials related to the life of the survivors after the Holocaust. Among these materials, the Yad Vashem Archives holds individual documents such as letters, diaries, photos, films, testimonies and personal documents which had been donated to the Archives by individuals. Many of these documents are original. Other types of documents available in the archives are those which were created by Jewish organizations before, during and after the Holocaust; many of these documents are original as well. Additional materials that the Yad Vashem Archives has been collecting and acquiring from its beginning are official documents which were created by various authorities and organizations from all over Europe which participated in the persecution and the destruction of the Jews in Europe during the Nazi Period. Most of these materials had been acquired from Archives in Germany and in other countries which were under German occupation during the Second World War.\r\n\r\n","openingTimes":"https://www.yadvashem.org/visiting/opening-hours.html","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[31.77334,35.17794]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"il","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/il-002798","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/il-002798/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/il"},"meta":{"subitems":1615,"updated":"2022-07-27T16:35:15.715Z"}},{"id":"us-005561","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"American Jewish Historical Society","parallelFormsOfName":[],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"160 Herrick Road Newton Centre","city":"Massachusetts Hill","region":"Massachusetts","country":"United States","countryCode":"US","email":["info@ajhs.org"],"telephone":["+1 617 559 8600"],"fax":["+1 800 866 4814"],"url":["https://www.ajhs.org/"]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"us","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/us-005561","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/us-005561/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/us"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2022-07-27T09:23:06.563Z"}},{"id":"be-002171","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Ministère des Travaux publics et de la Reconstruction, Administration Dommages de Guerre / Ministerie van Transport en Infrastructuur, Dienst Oorlogsschade","parallelFormsOfName":["Department of Public Works and Reconstruction, Administration War Damage"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"country":"Belgium","countryCode":"BE","email":[],"telephone":[],"fax":[],"url":[]},"history":"On 15 August 1917, the Ministry of Justice created the War Damage Service.

The University of Thessaloniki started operating in 1925 and the University Library was founded in 1927. All schools of the University including the Library were located in a building right next to the Jewish cemetery. The mansion on the Ethnikis Amynis St served as the 2nd Military Hospital of the city during the WWI and hosted the university administration and the library till the 1970s.\r\n\r\nThe AUTh Library started operating in 1927 with an almost zero budget. The need for scholar information motivated professors and Greek scholars from diaspora to actively engage in enriching the library’s collections. The initial core of the Library collection was the donation of G. Konstantinidis, books from school libraries, namely Gymnasium of Thessaloniki, the All-Male Teacher Training School and the Education Academy of Thessaloniki. To this initial core more books from school collections were added; books that were initially collected for the \"Frontistirion\" of Trebizond (K. Konstantinidis’ donation) but never reached Asia Minor due to the destruction of 1922 and books from other Asia Minor schools saved from destruction and transferred in Thessaloniki by the “Fund for Exchangeable Property”. Georgios Konstantinidis was a former National Library of Greece Director (1890-91, 1895) and donated his library of 8.000 books to the Aristotle University. Gymnasium of Thessaloniki was a Hellenic school operating during the Ottoman occupation in Thessaloniki and its books were mostly Ancient Greek literature classics. All-Male Teacher Training School was a 3-year school operating during 1914-1929. Its books were mostly historic and travel books. K. Konstantinidis was a rich trader from Trebizond (1856 - 1930) that worked hard for the creation of an independent Democracy of Pontos. Library's collection further developed through printed journals subscriptions and important private collections either donated or purchased, such as N. Politis, A. Svolos, A. Delmouzos, A. Papanastassiou, M. Triantafyllidis, A. Pallis, I. Trikoglou collections.\r\n\r\nThanks to all these efforts, the AUTh Library collections go back in time presenting diversity in terms of language, place, genre, and format. Some collection highlights include 113 manuscripts dating from the 10th century, rare books dating from 1495, and maps from the 16th century. Nowadays, the library’s collection includes more than 1.302.000 printed and electronic books, access to 16.000 electronic journals and 64 bibliographic databases (AUTh Library and HEAL-Link consortium subscriptions). The AUTh Library actively supports the Open Access Movement since 2003. Hence, digitization and open access to theses and dissertations awarded from AUTh are two ongoing services reaching in total more than 4.000.000 million pages (archival collections, books, articles, newspapers, doctoral & postgraduate dissertations, research papers published by AUTh Faculty, etc.).\r\nCommunities and important Greek scholars continue to enrich the collections. Professors leaving on pension often donate their collections and papers to the Library. In 2014, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki was offered access to the Visual History Archive (USC Shoah Foundation, c2019), a collection of interviews of Holocaust and other genocides’ survivors. In 2018, the Visual History Archive became a Proquest company product. The perpetual access to the archive was donated to Aristotle University of Thessaloniki by the German Consulate in Thessaloniki as a tribute to the 60.000 Jews from Thessaloniki that were deported to Nazi concentration camps. In 2016, professor I. Megas and poet N. Christianopoulos donated their collections to Aristotle University containing thousands of postcards, art items, books, manuscripts, correspondence, interviews, journals, etc. In 2019, the Central Macedonia Regional Unit and its Cultural Centre have donated the “Centre for the Study and Development of Hellenic Culture of the Black Sea” archives and the library. The Black Sea Centre was founded in 1996 and operated until 2011. During its operations, the Black Sea Centre developed a series of cultural activities, it actively recorded the presence of Greeks in the area in terms of monitoring the numbers of Greek education schools and teachers, and clubs. Moreover, it gained copies from former USSR archives or State Archives from Black Sea countries that involved the Greek presence in the area. The Endowed Chair of Pontic Studies took the initiative for this donation and the transfer costs were covered by the Charitable Foundation of Ivan Savvidi.\r\n\r\nExcerpt from the following article: Koseoglou, E., & Zapounidou, S.

The Faculty of Philosophy established, as early as the initial years of its functioning, the principles by which it would work, displaying a high degree of progressivism in terms of spirit and language, compared to the Faculty of Philosophy in Athens, as well as contributing to the character of the University. The Faculty of Philosophy was the only school of the University at that time and opened its doors to 65 students in 1926.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the Faculty has been twofold; on the one hand, to educate competent staff for Greece’s Secondary Education and, on the other hand, to mold scholars who can contribute to research in a wide range of areas of historical and social studies and of the humanities, which is the task of any Faculty of Philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe School of History and Archaeology, which has been Department of the Faculty of Philosophy since its foundation, currently consists of four sections: (a) Ancient Greek, Roman, Byzantine Medieval History, (b) Modern and Contemporary History, Folklore and Social Anthropology, (c) Archeology, (d) Art History. Each section independently develops its research activities but collectively implements a common Curriculum.","buildings":"The Faculty of Philosophy was first housed in the “Allatini” building, which now hosts the Prefecture of Thessaloniki services. Soon, however, the location proved to be problematic and, in October 1927, it was transferred to a mansion in Ethnikis Amynis street. It was situated next to the Jewish Cemetery and was built in 1888 by Vitaliano Poselli to housethe Ottoman school “Idadie”. After the annexation of Thessaloniki to the Greek state, the building housed the 2nd Military Hospital.\r\nThe building was renovated in 1932 to host all schools of the University, as well as its library. In 1942, during the German Occupation of Thessaloniki, the Jewish Cemetery was destroyed by Nazis and their Greek collaborators. After the end of WWII, the field of the cemetery was granted by the Greek State to the University of Thessaloniki in order to build new buildings. \r\nToday, the School of History and Archaeology is housed in the New Building of the Faculty of Philosophy, which is right next to the historic (old) building of Ethnikis Amynis street. The old building houses part of the School’s activities. The administrative services of the School are in the 2nd floor of the Administration Building (K. Karathodoris).","holdings":"The School of History and Archaeology holds a History Archive since 1927. Today the Archive is located in a special section of the Library of Modern and Contemporary History, on the 4th floor of the New Building of the Faculty of Philosophy. The collections were obtained by donations or purchases and include original historical documents, copies of documents or manuscripts, newspapers, history maps, microfilms, as well as rare documents from various archives and libraries – in Greece and abroad – related to modern and contemporary Greek history.\r\n\r\nThe Library of Folklore and Social Anthropology which serves the School’s students and scientific staff holds the Archive of Stilpon Kyriakidis who served as a dean at the Aristotle University during 1934–1935 and during the period of the anti-jewish measures in Thessaloniki (1942-1943). The Archive consists of papers, articles and notes concerning his academic interests, as well as parts of his personal and academic correspondence.\r\n\r\nExcept from archival holdings in paper form, the School of History and Archaeology has developed an effort to promote digital approaches to archival material. In particular, the Chair of Jewish Studies in collaboration with scholars from AUTh as well as other Greek and European Universities developed a research project and a website concerning the Nazi Concentration Camps in Greece, 1941-1944.","openingTimes":"After communication at: istoriko.arheio@hist.auth.gr","conditions":"Access is open to researchers.

Our goal is to capture the phenomenon of exile in all its variety and to facilitate access to our holdings.\r\nThe establishment of the Exile Archive during the early post-war period was initiated by a number of émigrés and other persons, who saw it as an instrument of political enlightenment. This is another reason why we attach particular importance to the dissemination of cultural knowledge: we use exhibitions, publications and a varied events programme to communicate the complexity of exile between 1933 and 1945.

They envisioned the Museum as a place which could hold their stories and personal objects, memorialise those who were murdered during the Holocaust, and within which the lessons from the past would be taught.\r\n\r\n26 years since its inception, the Museum continues to give a voice to the victims of the Holocaust so their stories can start conversations and inspire change.","generalContext":"The Sydney Jewish Museum is dedicated to documenting and teaching the history of the Holocaust. The world-class museum challenges visitors’ perceptions of democracy, morality, social justice and human rights and places the Holocaust in its historical and contemporary context.","buildings":"The Sydney Jewish Museum is housed within the historic New South Wales Jewish Memorial Hall – commonly known as the Maccabean Hall, or ‘the Macc’. The Inter-War Classical style building was designed in the 1920s by Sydney architect Gordon Keesing. The Maccabean Hall was established with two main functions: to operate as a communal centre for the social and educational activities of Sydney’s Jewish community, and to stand as a memorial to Jewish soldiers from New South Wales who served in World War I.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1940s, the Maccabean Hall held more than 90 percent of the Sydney Jewish community’s activities and functions. The community centre became crucial in rehabilitating and integrating Jewish refugees from Europe in the late 1940s and early 1950s, after World War II. Its spaces were used for English lessons for migrants, weddings, weekly Sunday dances, meetings, rallies and commemorative events for Anzac soldiers and Holocaust victims.\r\n\r\nThe building was expanded along Darlinghurst Road in 1965 by architect Henry Epstein in a Brutalist architectural style. Epstein’s modernist façade features a large concrete sculpture of an abstracted seven-branch Menorah by 20th century Australian sculptor Lyndon Dadswell.\r\n\r\nSince 1992, the Maccabean Hall building has been home to the Sydney Jewish Museum. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was increasing awareness of the importance of speaking about the Holocaust, particularly amongst Holocaust survivors in the community. The survivors, who made up a large proportion of the Jewish community after WWII, were instrumental in taking the steps to designate the Maccabean Hall as a space within which stories from the Holocaust could be preserved and taught. This space was a natural choice for the community as it represented continuity due to the building’s longstanding communal function for Jewish people.\r\n\r\nIn the designing of the Sydney Jewish Museum in the 1980s, the original Art Deco barrel-vaulted ceiling of the Maccabean Hall was maintained. Architect Michael Bures designed a sculptural staircase that takes the shape of the Star of David, the universal Jewish symbol. This construction created a central void that connects the exhibition platforms with the building’s historical features.\r\n\r\nThe Sydney Jewish Museum is located on the traditional lands of the Gadigal people of the Eora nations. We recognise the Gadigal people of the Eora nation as the traditional owners and ongoing custodians of the land upon which the Museum is situated.","holdings":"The Sydney Jewish Museum collects and conserves original memorabilia related to the Holocaust, Judaica and Australian Jewish history to make these available for display and research for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThe Holocaust collection covers broad aspects ranging from pre-war life to survivors’ migration to Australia and the later War Crime Trials.\r\n\r\nObjects in the Australian Jewish History collection trace life in Australia from the arrival of the first convicts and free settlers to the present; there is a strong focus on servicemen and women.\r\n\r\nThe *Sydney Jewish Museum’s Resource Centre* has more than 6,000 volumes, audio and videotapes, journals and personal testimonies, including the Shoah Testimonies.\r\n\r\nThe Centre holds over 2,500 testimonies from Holocaust survivors interviewed in Australia. These testimonies are part of a collection of more than 53,000 testimonies gathered by the Shoah Foundation, spearheaded by Steven Spielberg. The individual testimonies have been digitised and are housed at the USC Shoah Foundation (University of Southern California).","openingTimes":"The Library is staffed by a qualified librarian and is open Monday – Thursday 10am-4pm, and on Sundays 11am-3pm by appointment.","researchServices":"The Sydney Jewish Museum Resource Centre houses the Survivors Registry and contains resources which members of the public may use to determine the fate of Holocaust victims or survivors.

Consequent to the horrible expulsion from Spain by Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492, Jews began to arrive in the safe haven of the city in big numbers bringing with them an awareness of Renaissance culture and languages of the Western Mediterranean.","buildings":"The Museum is housed in one of the rare Jewish buildings in the city centre that survived the fire of 1917. The building belongs to the Jewish Community of Thessaloniki since it was erected, in 1904. It was originally built to house business activities and has housed the Bank of Athens and the Jewish newspaper \"L' Independent\". The building was renovated between 1997-2000 and 2016-2019. Today the Museum occupies approximately 1.000 square meters instead of the 500 sq. m. it used to occupy since its opening, in 2001.That means that the space available for exhibitions has doubled and that the permanent exhibits have been updated up to 80%.","holdings":"The archival holdings of the Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki cover the 20th century, mainly. The holdings are divided into five main categories. The following division was created empirically, regarding that the Museum evolved gradually over time as an archival institution.\r\n1. Paper records: All paper records are catalogued. Someone can find communal archives (Thessaloniki, Kavala), archives of business activities, archives of maps and plans and private collections.\r\n2. Photo Archive: The photo archive was created from donations by Jewish families and covers multiple aspects of Jewish life in Thessaloniki. It consists of two main units: the pre-war and the after-war archive. The archive is catalogued and can be accessed digitally in the JMTH Library.\r\n3. Music Archive: The creation of a music archive is the main aim of JMTH during 2020-2022. It consists of interviews, recordings and professional performances of some selected songs.\r\n4. Digital Archives: The digital archives of JMTH include databases accessible through the JMTH library, as well as databases with open access to the public. \r\n5. Newspapers and Library: JMTH holds a collection of Jewish newspapers, as well as some copies of collaborationist press during the Occupation in Thessaloniki. The Library holds a collection of books regarding the history of Thessaloniki, of Jews, of Israel and of Judaism. Also, the Library provides access to the Visual History Archive University of Southern California Shoah Foundation Institute, a collection of interviews of Holocaust survivors.\r\n","openingTimes":"Monday-Friday: 09:00-14:00,\r\nWednesday: 09:00-14:00 & 17:00-20:00,\r\nSunday: 10:00-14:00.\r\nThe Museum is closed on Saturdays and on public and religious holidays\r\n","researchServices":"A research and documentation center operates within the premises, which aims to document and digitize archival documents from the Museum's own collection as well as archival material from other sources, thus creating a database accessible to visitors. The library houses important texts that were printed in Thessaloniki from the 16th to the 20th century, covering almost every aspect of Jewish life, religious and secular. The library acts also as a repository for books on the history, customs and language of the Sephardi Jews.

It is comprised of two distinct departments: central archive (founded 1937) and research. Both sections focus on the history and current issues of the kibbutz movement, the youth movement and Israeli society. The center, through its documentation, research, publications and public activities, preserves and promotes the movement heritage and exposes its many facets – past and present: the historical, cultural, economic, political, educational, sociological and more. The archive also serves as a home for other allied organizations such as Peace Now. Yad Yaari supports and works towards peace, social solidarity and social advancement as reflected in the kibbutz ideals and legacy. ","holdings":"The first steps and the development of the Archive were integrated with the development of the Kibbutz Artzi Federation. Kibbutz Artzi and its secretariat were founded in 1927. For a decade the archive material wandered, stored in sacks (according to popular legend), from settlement to settlement, depending on where the secretariat was located at the time. In 1937 the Archive was set up in one of the rooms of the Movement House in Merchavia by Shlomo Rechav. The economic base for the Archive consisted of three workdays a week and one Mandatory Lira (pound, the currency in use at the time). Shlomo Rechav, who was acutely aware of the historical importance of the Archive, succeeded in obtaining material from HaShomer HaTzair in the various European countries. Whatever didn’t find its way to the Archive by 1939, and wasn’t held personally by former members of the movement, was lost. The Archive includes millions of varied documents: publications including journals, visual items and audio-visual material. Most of the material is computerized and conveniently accessible. The material is kept in three air-conditioned storerooms, safeguarded against fire, damage by natural causes, or human intervention. The Photograph Archive consists of 70,000 photographs and another approximately 4,000 of the Moreshet Archive. All the photographs have been cataloged in the archive computer system and about half of them have been scanned already. In addition, the Archive holds the Al HaMishmar newspaper's photograph collection, consisting of some 120,000 items. The HaShomer HaTzair Archive also includes a considerable number of sections on HaShomer HaTzair in the early years of the Twentieth Century, and material on youth movements that preceded HaShomer HaTzair. The Archive is divided into three major bodies of material: 1.\tThe world HaShomer HaTzair Movement from its beginning up to the present; 2.\tThe political activity of HaShomer HaTzair in Israel and abroad from its beginning up to the present (Mapam, Meretz-Yachad, more); 3.\tThe various activities and departments of Kibbutz Artzi, its cultural and economic institutions.","openingTimes":"The Archive is open to the public Sunday through Thursday from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM.\r\nResearchers are kindly asked to schedule their visits in advance."},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"il","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/il-002779","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/il-002779/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/il"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2022-05-01T08:40:37.892Z"}},{"id":"il-002808","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Yad Tabenkin, יד טבנקין, המרכז המחקרי, הרעיוני והתיעודי של התנועה הקיבוצית","parallelFormsOfName":["Research and Documentation Center of the United Kibbutz Movement"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"contactPerson":"Aharon Azati","streetAddress":"1 Hayasmin St.","city":"Ramat Ef‘al","region":"Tel Aviv","postalCode":"52960","country":"Israel","countryCode":"IL","email":["rsoboly-t@bezegint.net","aharon.azati@yadtabenkin.org.il","yadtabmaz@bezeqint.net"],"telephone":["972-3-5344458"],"fax":["972-3-5346376"],"url":["http://www.ic.org/icsa/efal.html#Anchor-Yad-47857","https://yadtabenkin.org.il/%D7%90%D7%95%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%99%D7%93-%D7%98%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%9F/yad-tabenkin-what-we-do/#team"]},"generalContext":"Yad Tabenkin, the research and documentation center of the Kibbutz Movement, is a registered association (NPO) whose vision is to preserve the history of the Kibbutz Movement, Zionist youth movements from across the globe, key aspects of the history of the 'Yishuv' and the modern State of Israel and to research its past and present.\r\n\r\nYad Tabenkin's aim is to tell the story of the pioneering youth movements, past and present, communal settlement movements in Israel and in the world, and the unique community that is known as \"the kibbutz\".","buildings":"The archive and the research and reference library are housed in the Yad Tabenkin building which is situated amidst a beautiful campus on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.

This database will be part of a website that will include, chronology, bibliography, information on conferences and publications, interactive learning, options for depositing source material and a forum for researchers and teachers.\r\n \r\nIt is of paramount importance to obtain the testimonies of Jews from North Africa living in Israel and abroad who experienced World War II.

The first Director was the late Dr. Geoffrey Wigoder and the Archive originally bore the name of its first donor, Iranian businessman Abraham F. Rad, who gave his support for a number of years. In 1987 a generous donation was received from Steven Spielberg and the Archive was named after the American filmmaker, whose continuing interest in our activities is a source of pride. At the Scopus Dinner held in Los Angeles in December 2000, the American Friends of the Hebrew University honored the late Jack Valenti, Former Chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America. At the dinner it was announced that the premises housing the Steven Spielberg Jewish Film Archive would be named the Jack Valenti Pavilion.\r\nIn 1973 the World Zionist Organization (WZO) designated the Archive as the official depository of its films. Today the Archive is jointly administered by the University's Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry and the Central Zionist Archives of the WZO and has the status of a Special Collection of the Jewish National and University Library. It is affiliated with the International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF) and the Association of Moving Image Archivists (AMIA).\r\n\r\nIn 1996 the Archive moved to specially designed premises at the University's Faculty of Humanities.\r\n\r\nThe Archive engages in many types of activities. Among these are lectures, film research, preservation of films in danger of decay, distribution, and digitization and accessibility.\r\n\r\nThe Archive serves a wide audience: film producers and directors, researchers, educational purposes - students, lecturers at the university, schools, cultural centers, old age homes, and the general public interested in Zionism.\r\n\r\n","holdings":"The Steven Spielberg Jewish Film Archive holds approximately 18,000 titles on film, video and dvd, constituting one of the largest collections of Jewish documentary film footage in the world. The vaults contain material shot in Israel before and after the establishment of the State in 1948, motion picture records of many Jewish communities in the Diaspora and two special collections relating to the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nearly zionism and the state of Israel\r\n\r\nAs the official film archive of the World Zionist Organization and its subsidiaries, including the Jewish Agency, Keren Kayemeth Leisrael (Jewish National Fund) and Keren Hayesod (Palestine Foundation Fund, later United Jewish Appeal), the Spielberg Archive is particularly strong in its coverage of Zionist activity before and after 1948.\r\nThe Spielberg Archive's collection contains films documenting Jewish life in communities all over the world. Among the many regions and periods represented are: Poland before World War II, Europe, Morocco in the early 1960s, Ethiopia, China, North and South America, South Africa, Australia, the Soviet Union and the CIS.\r\n\r\nBeth Hatefutsoth, Israel's Diaspora Museum, has deposited all its films, expanding the geographical and chronological range of the Archive's holdings.\r\nIn addition to individual films dealing with aspects of the Holocaust (including rare color footage of Hitler and Mussolini at the Eastern Front, taken by Hitler's pilot), the Spielberg Archive houses two unique collections. Since the early 1970s, the original videotapes of the Adolf Eichmann Trial have been at the Archive, as a gift from the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith. In 1996 these were transferred to the Beta digital format and the originals placed in permanent storage at the Israel State Archive, which funded the preservation effort. A set in the NTSC standard was donated to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nThe second collection is one from the Ghetto Fighters' House (Beit Lohamei Haghetaot), one of Israel's major Shoah research centers. Following a 1997 agreement between the two institutions, several hundred films are being permanently deposited at the Archive. Video copies have been made for continuing educational use at the Ghetto Fighters' House and the entire project is being funded through the generosity of Gerda Steinitz Frieberg of Toronto, Canada.\r\n\r\nhome movies\r\n\r\nThe Spielberg Archive has a growing collection of films made non-professionally in Eretz Israel and the Diaspora by private individuals. The value of such motion pictures is gaining increasing recognition worldwide. Many dozens of films in this category from the 1920s onward are held at the Archive and contain important documentation of both daily life and historic events.\r\n\r\n","openingTimes":"The Steven Spielberg Jewish Film Archive is open, by prior appointment only, Sunday through Thursday 09:00-16:30.\r\n\r\nThe Archive's catalog is available 24 hours a day online."},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"il","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/il-002796","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/il-002796/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/il"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2022-04-29T06:55:20.905Z"}},{"id":"il-002800","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Shem Olam/ שם עולם","parallelFormsOfName":["Shem Olam, faith and the Holocaust Institute for Education Documentation and Research"],"otherFormsOfName":[],"address":{"streetAddress":"Shem Olam Institute","city":"Kfar Haroeh","region":"Central District","postalCode":"3895500","country":"Israel","countryCode":"IL","email":["shemolam@shemolam.org.il"],"telephone":["+972-4-6366011","+972-4-6301637"],"fax":["+972-4-6365929"],"url":["http://en.shemolam.org.il/","http://en.shemolam.org.il/default.asp?catid=%7B213978B7-0B56-40EC-8C88-DADFC5E383D9%7D"]},"history":"The Shem Olam Institute has harnessed itself and others to carry out research using historical scientific tools, while uncovering documents and unfamiliar sources relating to the world of values, faith, religious and spiritual life, which focus attention on coping in the Holocaust.

The holdings are roughly divided into the following three main categories: 1) Communal and Zionist entities, 2) papers and notes on subjects of Jewish concern, 3) personal files (including ketubot, diplomas and genealogical data). They include some original material, correspondence, photocopies of official and internal sources, mostly concerning pre-Holocaust events, some of them pertaining to the 19th century. There are files which contain evidence on personalities, rabbis, economic and social activities and information regarding Jewish participation in patriotic wars, and, particularly, in the anti-Fascist partisan movement during World War II.

The idea of establishing Massuah began taking shape in the early 1960s and came from two directons; one began with the conference on heroism that was held at Kibbutz Tel Yitzhak on the Holocaust Remembrance Day, initiated by kibbutz members, some of whom were Holocaust survivors. Additional initiators were members of Hanoar Hazioni who came from Zaglebie in western Poland. These members, called Nasha Groupa (our group), managed to escape Poland through Slovakia and Hungary in the midst of the Holocaust. Members of Nasha Groupa and members of Tel Yitzhak decided to establish a center and an amphitheater for events in the kibbutz. The cornerstone was laid in May 1965. The objective of the founders was to establish a memorial center for members of these movements. The prominent figure among the group members was Fredka Mazya. Unlike her contemporaries, Mazya envisioned a institution devoted chiefly to educational work and not the party, one that would hold in-depth seminars, whose objective would be to bring young people in Israel and throughout the world closer to the subject of the Holocaust and its meaning, and not concentrate on establishing a memorial site for members of one youth movement alone. The initiators managed to secure a budget for building the museum with the help of the then minister, Moshe Kol. The new institution began work in 1972, as an international seminar center, which includes a museum, an educational center, and archival center for the movement.","holdings":"The Document Archive comprises a collection of documents and publications related to the Holocaust, the Jewish world prior to the Holocaust – community institutions, youth movements, collections of personal documents, Brichah [Escape, the organized effort that helped Jews escape post-Holocaust Europe to Palestine] and She’erit Hapleita [literally, the surviving remnant].

Unknowingly, his work formed the basis of realizing the 1933 resolution of the movement's Central Institution to establish an archive — to be called the \"Betar Museum\" — to serve as the official repository of the movement's publications. \r\nThe Institute's beginnings were quite humble: From its first home in the laboratory of Kupat Holim Leumit (the Leumit Sick Fund) on 44 Nachlat Benyamin St., Tel Aviv, it moved to the basement of the “Metzuda” on King George Street, until finally reaching the present location on the first floor of Beit Jabotinsky. \r\nIn 1947, shortly before the British authorities outlawed Betar, Pa’amoni and friends decided to change the name of the \"Betar Museum\" to \"The Jabotinsky Institute,\" thus saving the museum and its collections from confiscation by the CID (British Intelligence). \r\nIn 1958, the Jabotinsky Institute's archive was recognized as a Public Historical Archive, in accordance with the Archives’ Law (1955). \r\nThrough the years, the Institute has grown to include a state-of-the-art museum, open to the public, and an impressive program of study days and seminars attracting growing numbers of audiences. To broaden its scope, the Institute has undertaken an ongoing commitment to initiating research, publishing books, and other activities of national and international status.

Upon Einstein's death in 1955, Dr. Nathan devoted himself tirelessly for more than a quarter of a century to the administration of the Estate of Albert Einstein. In close cooperation with the co-Trustee of the Estate, Ms. Helen Dukas, Dr. Nathan succeeded in tripling the size of the Albert Einstein Archives during the period 1955-1982. As Executor to Einstein's writings, Dr. Nathan cooperated with numerous publishers throughout the world in the publication in a wide variety of languages of many new editions of Einstein's works. Dr. Nathan shared Einstein's leftist views on politics and society - this affinity led to his editing (in collaboration with Heinz Norden) a selection of Einstein's writings on pacifism entitled Einstein on Peace in 1960. Dr. Nathan also laid a substantial part of the groundwork for the historical edition of The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein. In 1982, the Estate of Albert Einstein transferred all the literary rights to Einstein's writings to The Hebrew University of Jerusalem - in accordance with Einstein's Will of 1950. During the period of 1982-1990, the American Friends of the Hebrew University (AFHU) in New York were responsible for dealing with all copyright issues pertaining to Einstein's writings. This work was carried out meticulously and conscientiously by the late Ehud Benamy of the AFHU, under the sagacious guidance of the late Prof. Milton Handler. In 1991, the Executive of The Hebrew University in Jerusalem decided to transfer responsibility for all copyright issues pertaining to Albert Einstein to the office of the Curator of the Albert Einstein Archives in Jerusalem.

Representing the intellectual and personal record of a creative genius whose thinking profoundly changed our perception of the universe, it is of inestimable value.

The preservation of his papers, which most authentically reflect his ideas and person, affords a far more fitting means of maintaining his legacy.\r\n\r\nThe Albert Einstein Archives contains the largest collection of original manuscripts by Einstein in the world and includes his vast correspondence with the most influential physicists and intellectuals of the 20th century.

After the war, JDC mobilized to support and resettle survivors, help reconstruct the remnant communities of Europe, create a network of social welfare services in the fledgling State of Israel, set up an extensive assistance program for Jews in North Africa and the Muslim world, and provide discreet relief behind the Iron Curtain. With the fall of Communism, JDC established cultural and educational programs to foster a sense of Jewish identify in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union and developed a broad welfare system for needy elderly and holocaust survivors.\r\n\r\nActive today in more than 70 countries, JDC and its partners work to alleviate hunger and hardship, rescue Jews in danger, create lasting connections to Jewish life, and help Israel overcome the social challenges of its most vulnerable citizens, both Jewish and non-Jewish. JDC’s reach extends beyond the global Jewish community by providing non-sectarian disaster relief and long-term development assistance worldwide.\r\n","holdings":"The JDC Archives houses one of the most significant collections in the world for the study of modern Jewish history.
