The Second World War was far from over, yet those countries were looking for ways and means to reconstruct their systems of education once peace was restored. Very quickly, the project gained momentum and soon took on a universal note. New governments, including that of the United States, decided to join in.\r\n\r\nUpon the proposal of CAME, a United Nations Conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization (ECO/CONF) was convened in London from 1 to 16 November 1945. Scarcely had the war ended when the conference opened. It gathered together the representatives of forty-four countries who decided to create an organization that would embody a genuine culture of peace. In their eyes, the new organization must establish the “intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind” and, in so doing, prevent the outbreak of another world war.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the conference, thirty-seven countries founded the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The Constitution of UNESCO, signed on 16 November 1945, came into force on 4 November 1946 after ratification by twenty countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Lebanon, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, United Kingdom and United States. The first session of the General Conference of UNESCO was held in Paris from 19 November to 10 December 1946 with the participation of representatives from 30 governments entitled to vote.\r\n\r\nThe political divisions of the Second World War marked the composition of the founding Member States of UNESCO. It was not until 1951 that Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany became Members, and Spain was accepted in 1953. Other major historical factors, such as the Cold War, the decolonization process and the dissolution of the USSR, also left their trace on UNESCO. The USSR joined UNESCO in 1954 and was replaced by the Russian Federation in 1992 alongside 12 former Soviet republics. Nineteen African states became Members in the 1960s.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of its entry into the United Nations, the People's Republic of China has been the only legitimate representative of China at UNESCO since 1971. The German Democratic Republic was a Member from 1972 to 1990, when it joined the Federal Republic of Germany.\r\n\r\nSome countries withdrew from the Organization for political reasons at various points in time, but they have today all rejoined UNESCO. South Africa was absent from 1957 to 1994, the United States of America between 1985 to 2003, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from 1986 to 1997 and Singapore from 1986 to 2007.

It was established after the merger of the four historical services of the Army, Navy and Air Force and the Gendarmerie, as well as the archival centre of weapons and personnel of Chatellerault. The SHD is spread over several sites in Vincennes, Cherbourg, Brest, Lorient, Rochefort, Toulon and Caen, with depots Le Blanc and Fontainebleau.","holdings":"Thanks to the Service Historique de la Défense , researchers can access the Minstry of Defence’s vast collection of records dating back as far as the 17th century. The core of these records is made up of documents from the Ministry of Defence and consequently, of the armed forces. To this have been incorporated collections from the General Delegation for Ordnance, the Secretariat-General for National Defence - a department falling under the remit of the prime minister - and collections from the ministry of war veterans that became part of the state department and were recently placed under the authority of the Ministry of Defence. The Defence Historical Service has gathered its exceptional record collections in its two centres in Vincennes and Châtellerault. These collections provide the main source of French military history since the 17th Century. Correspondence from ministers, their offices and headquarters, unit war diaries, or even private records from top political and military figures; all this enables historians to retrace campaigns from Louis XIV and the epic actions of the great Napoleon army to the most recent conflicts of our time. In addition to the different aspects of these great conflicts that have shaped Europe, these records shed light on the strategic and military issues of international politics, with a wealth of information on Africa and Asia through the records of the French armies overseas. Although they are essential for research into military history, these records are also of great interest for their documentation of the cultural, diplomatic, scientific, economic and social history of France and other nations. From the first marine atlases to aerial photographs, the Records of the Ministry of Defence holds documents containing a wealth of information, works of engineers and military cartographers who, since the 16th Century, have exercised their talents on land, sea and in the air. They show how these skilled professionals contributed not only to geographic knowledge of the national territory, but also to the evolution of map-making techniques. Finally, the technical record collections describe studies and tests concerning the production of weapons show the influence of the defence services on scientific and technical development. The history of national defence also concerns the lives of individuals who fought in the ranks of the French army over many centuries. Although conscription records are sent by the ministry to the regional records relating to each person in question, the centre in Vincennes holds individual files on officers of the three armed forces and the national Gendarmerie, dating from the 18th Century. The centre in Châtellerault houses civilian files dating from the end of the 19th Century. The collective records from various units add to or provide these sources from individuals and personnel who contributed to the manufacture of weapons. Apart from the ministry personnel or the armies, the two world wars of the 20th Century involved the whole nation. Hence, the register of those who died for France in the First World War, files on resistance networks or registers from concentration camps, all record the names of hundreds of thousands of people and shed a little light on the history of every citizen whose name is entered.\r\n\r\nThe Chateau de Vincennes holds the archives of the Ministry of Defence (and its precedents), inter-army organisations (\"organismes interarmées\"), the Army, the Air Force, *la gendarmerie nationale*, the Navy General Staff and of navy organisations based in Ile-de-France.

It is estimated that over 10,000 men, women and children were imprisoned in Montluc, and over 900 of them were executed within it. \r\n\r\nIn mid-August 1944, prisoners from Montluc were taken to Bron Airfield where 109 of them, including 72 Jews, were killed in what would become known as Le Charnier de Bron (\"The Charnel house of Bron\").\r\n\r\nMontluc was liberated on 24 August 1944 by FFI troops, when resistance leader Colonel Köenig, profiting from the chaos reigning in Lyon at the time, entered the prison in a stolen German Army car disguised as a Gestapo officer and persuaded the Commandant to free the prisoners, saying that the order had come from the Gestapo Commander in Lyon, Klaus Barbie.\r\n\r\nIn 1947, Montluc became a civil prison once again, finally closing in 1997, though the female maison d'arrêt was not closed until May 2009.","openingTimes":"September to June: Wednesday to Saturday: 2pm - 5:30pm\r\nJuly - August: Tuesday to Saturday: 9:00am - 12:00pm and 2pm to 5:30pm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","geo":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[45.7507135,4.8615792]}},"relationships":{"country":{"data":{"id":"fr","type":"Country"}}},"links":{"self":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/fr-006278","search":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/fr-006278/search","country":"https://portal.ehri-project.eu/api/v1/fr"},"meta":{"subitems":0,"updated":"2022-02-23T12:02:44.714Z"}},{"id":"fr-006279","type":"Repository","attributes":{"name":"Mémorial du camp de Rivesaltes","parallelFormsOfName":["Memorial of the camp of Rivesaltes"],"otherFormsOfName":["Camp Joffre"],"address":{"streetAddress":"Avenue Christian Bourquin","city":"Salses le Château","postalCode":"66600","country":"France","countryCode":"FR","email":["info@memorialcamprivesaltes.fr"],"telephone":["+33 (0) 4 68 08 34 90","+33 (0) 4 68 08 39 70"],"fax":["+33 (0) 4 68 08 34 99"],"url":["https://www.memorialcamprivesaltes.eu/"]},"history":"On 12th November 1938, the French government promulgated a law that administratively interned the « indesirable foreigners.” This law permits the arrest and emprisonment of persons not for crimes, the anti-Franquists and volontaries of the International Brigades.  \r\nIn 1939, 450 000 pass the border into France. Some of them find themselves at Rivesaltes where the military camp Joffre is being rearranged to accommodate them. Starting from June-July 1940, more than 50 000 prisoners are transferred to the camps in the south of France, in the non-Occupied Zone. The conditions in the camp are precarious and this will increase on 14th January 1941 when other prisoners from other camps are transported to Rivesaltes. They are Spaniards, Jews and Gypsies. \r\n\r\nBetween August and Novembre 1942 close to 10.000 Jews will be delivered to the Reich by the Vichy Regime. At Rivesaltes, 2313 men, women and children will be deported during nine convoys. The first deportation from Rivesaltes takes place on 11th August 1942 to Drancy. By mid-September Rivesaltes becomes an interregional centre of deportation of all Jews in the non-Occupied Zone. From the 5000 interned Jews at Rivesaltes between August and Novembre 1942, more than half will be able to escape the convoys due to aide of different organisations (the Swiss Red Cross, OSE, Cimade, YMCA, Unitarian Service, etc.) but also , due to the prefect Paul Corazzi who manages to exclude a large part of the children from deportation. Since the existence of the camp, 17.500 persons have been interned at Rivesaltes, of which 53% were Spanish, 40% (foreign) Jews and 7% (French) Gypsies. On 22nd Novembre 1942, the camp becomes a military barrack for German troops.  \r\nAt the liberation of the Department of the Pyrénées-Orientales, the camp barracks will be reused as internment camp. The prisoners at this time are mainly people suspected of collaboration and black market traffickers. This occurs in September 1944 as the camp is renamed “centre of surveyed stays » (centre de séjour surveillé). In April 1945 the camp is transformed in a imprisonment camp for prisoners of war, mainly Germans but also Austrians and Italians. The number of prisoners climbs fast to more than 10.000 : the conditions deteriorate quickly and many will die in 1945. Some improvement is made in the summer of 1946 when the prisoners are used to work outside the encampment   and representation of the POW is implemented. The last prisoners will be released in 1948 and the camp will be henceforth  used again as “normal” military barracks. \r\n\r\nDuring the Algerian War, the camp is used first as military barracks for recruites waiting to be deployed overseas. Between January and May 1962, a part of the camp is transformed into a prison where prisoners of the National Liberation Front (Algerie). From September 1962, after the Algerian War ended, the Harki (muslim Algerians who served as auxiliaries in the French army during the war) are interned in the camp with their families. They are accommodated in military tents which increases the discomfort for the Harki as the 1962 winter is particularly harsh. The families are rehoused in the barracks, but the integration of the Harki into society is difficult since they were rejected from independent Algeria and thus left out by the French government. Many of them were hired in mining, steel industrie and industries in the north of France or are dispersed in different city borders especially constructed for the Harki. In December 1964, the camp of Rivesaltes will close officially, after having approximately 21 000 Harki and their families pass through. Since the departure of the Harki, the camp will be used to host soldiers from Guinea and their families (+/- 800) after the independence of Guinea in 1958. At the same time the Rivesaltes camp also hosts soldiers from French Indochina. The camp takes on one of its former roles, an administrative detention camp for expelled foreigners from 1986 to 2007. This centre will ultimately be relocated to Perpignan, since the camp at Rivesaltes  is transformed into a memorial.\r\n","holdings":"All archives of the camp are held at the Departmental archives of the Pyrénées Orientales.

These Jewish children’s families were of various origins: German, Polish, Austrian, Belgian or French – from Metropolitan France or Algeria. Many crossed Europe at different times, fleeing pogroms and anti-Semitic acts or misery, hoping to find refuge in France.\r\nIn September and October 1940, the Vichy regime enacted the first anti-Semitic laws.\r\nThese families found themselves entrapped by wartime Europe and anti-Semitic politics. Persecuted, hunted, arrested and interned in France, 76,000 Jewish people, including 11,400 children, would be handed over to the German authorities, then deported and murdered.\r\nHumanitarian organisations set up escape networks and tried to shield children from these persecutions.\r\nIn May 1943, Sabine and Miron Zlatin, in conjunction with the “Œuvre de Secours aux Enfants” (OSE) [French humanitarian organisation for Jewish children], took in some fifteen children at Izieu in the Italian Occupied Zone at that time, sheltering them temporarily from anti-Semitic manhunts.\r\nUp to January 1944, the month of the last list in the attendance register kept by Miron Zlatin, 105 children, mostly Jewish, had stayed at the Izieu home. The home was frequently a transit location within a much wider escape network integrating other houses, host families or transfer channels in Switzerland.\r\nOn 6th April 1944, 45 children and 8 adults were present at the home. All were Jewish except for one boy, René-Michel Wucher. Under the orders of Klaus Barbie, Gestapo agents and Wehrmacht soldiers were sent to arrest all those present. One adult, Léon Reifman, managed to escape and hide at the time of the raid. Little René-Michel Wucher was released when the lorries stopped at Brégnier-Cordon, a village below Izieu.\r\nThe raid on the Izieu home led to the arrest and deportation of 44 Jewish children (aged 5 to 17 years) and 7 adults. Miron Zlatin and 2 teenagers were shot at Reval (Tallin today) in Estonia.\r\n42 children and 5 adults were assassinated at Auschwitz-Birkenau.\r\nLéa Feldblum, a helper at the home, was the only survivor.","holdings":"Archives\r\n\r\nThe first archival collection from the Maison d’Izieu was transferred to the “Bibliothèque Nationale de France” [French National Library] by Sabine Zlatin in 1994, before the Maison d’Izieu opened. This collection, kept in the stamp and photographic department, consists of part of the documents she had kept since her return to the home a few weeks after the raid on 6th April 1944: children’s letters and drawings, photos of daily life at the home and its inhabitants, documents and letters concerning the creation and organisation of the Izieu home as well as the initiatives after the war to commemorate the children and adults deported and assassinated.\r\nThe “Bibliothèque Nationale de France” published an inventory of these documents in 1994.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this collection, the Maison d’Izieu archives include:\r\nDocuments and photographs from Sabine Zlatin’s estate, transferred to the Maison d’Izieu after her death in 1996, photographs donated by those who stayed at the home or were linked to it between 1943 and 1944: Henry Alexander, Alec Bergman, Juliette Collomb, Philippe Dehan, Guy Pallarés, Paulette Pallarés-Roche, Paul Niedermann, Marie Perticoz, Roger Perticoz, Samuel Pintel and Suzanne Reveillard.

As the population aged, the COJASOR directed its services toward the elderly in convalescent homes in Nice and in Aix-les-Bains as well as at home through the ADIAM, a home aid service and GADCOM, a homecare service. As of 1973, the COJASOR provided guardianship services for legally and functionally incapacitated individuals over the age of 18 years.\r\n\r\nAs of the mid- 1950’s, the COJASOR provided services for the waves of Jewish immigration from the Middle East and Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, the CASIP and COJASOR merged to become the CASIP-COJASOR Foundation. With support of the FMS (Fondation pour la Mémoire de Shoah), a service for the survivors of the Shoah and their beneficiaries is created in 2001.

It studies and documents the history of National Socialism’s mass crimes – particularly of the Holocaust – and their impact until the present. One focus of its work is facilitating relevant German and international research by means of publications, lectures and exhibitions.\r\nThe Institute is named for Fritz Bauer and is dedicated to his memory. Fritz Bauer (1903–1968) was a returned Jewish emigrant and, from 1956 on, a Hessian district attorney (Generalstaatsanwalt), who strove for the reconstruction of the legal system in the Federal Republic of Germany and fought for criminal persecution of Nazi crimes.\r\nThe Fritz Bauer Institute was founded in 1995 by the State of Hesse, the City of Frankfurt am Main and the friends’association Fritz Bauer Institut e.V. as a foundation under German public law. It was granted An-Institut status in autumn 2000, affiliating it with Goethe University Frankfurt am Main, and maintains its registered office in the IG Farben-Haus building on the university’s Westend campus. The State of Hesse, the City of Frankfurt, Goethe University and the friends’ association Fritz Bauer Institut e.V. are represented on the Institute’s foundation board. The friends’ association and the academic advisory board support and accompany its work. In 2017, the Chair for Research on the History and Impact of the Holocaust, the first of its type dedicated to this subject in Germany, was created in the History Seminar of Goethe University. The chair is linked to directorship of the Fritz Bauer Institute.\r\n\r\nDEU:\r\nDas Fritz Bauer Institut ist eine unabhängige, zeitgeschichtlich ausgerichtete und interdisziplinär orientierte Forschungs- und Bildungseinrichtung.

Fritz Bauer (1903–1968), jüdischer Remigrant und ab 1956 hessischer Generalstaatsanwalt, kämpfte für die Rekonstruktion des Rechtssystems in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland und für die strafrechtliche Verfolgung von NS-Verbrechern.\r\nDas Fritz Bauer Institut wurde 1995 vom Land Hessen, der Stadt Frankfurt am Main und dem Förderverein Fritz Bauer Institut e.V. als Stiftung bürgerlichen Rechts ins Leben gerufen. Als An-Institut ist es seit Herbst 2000 mit der Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main verbunden und hat seinen Sitz im IG Farben-Haus auf dem Campus Westend. Im Stiftungsrat des Instituts sind das Land Hessen, die Stadt Frankfurt, die Goethe-Universität und der Förderverein des Fritz Bauer Instituts e.V. vertreten. Der Förderverein und der Wissenschaftliche Beirat unterstützen und begleiten seine Arbeit. Im Jahr 2017 wurde der Lehrstuhl zur Geschichte und Wirkung des Holocaust, der erste in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland zu diesem Themenfeld, geschaffen und am Historischen Seminar der Goethe-Universität angesiedelt. Der Lehrstuhl ist mit der Leitung des Fritz Bauer Instituts verknüpft.\r\n","records":"The archive of the Fritz Bauer Institute was created when the Institute was founded.

The State Audiovisual Archive had to change its location several times and it was only after the renewal of Latvia’s independence that it obtained a permanent location, in 1994, in Riga at Šmerļa Street 5. On 3 March 2010 the President of the Republic of Latvia proclaimed a new Archives Law. According to this law, the former State archival system of Latvia has, since 1 January 2011, been reorganized within one body, the National Archives of Latvia (NAL). The National Archive of Latvia is the legal successor of the obligations and property of the former institutions of the State archival system.\r\n\r\nThe National Archives of Latvia collect and store records with archival value, provide access to these records, supervise the observance of records management in the institutions and in the accredited private archives, accredit private archives, and perform the other functions specified in the Archives Law The State Audiovisual Archive has become a structural unit/department of the National Archives of Latvia.","generalContext":"The State Audiovisual Archive maintains photo, sound, and audiovisual records from the whole country.","mandates":"The Archive collects and holds audiovisual, photo, and sound documents that are linked both to Latvia and to social, political, and cultural events.

The collection is constantly growing thanks to close co-operation with Latvia’s mass media and other producers of audiovisual documents. Since 2009 there has been a special repository for public electronic records of archival value. Records connected to the Holocaust can be found in the photo and in film collections.

The Second World War caused irreversible damage to the Estonian film collection. A large number of negatives from the Eesti Kultuurfilm (the Estonian Culture Film) that had been prepared for delivery to the archive were destroyed. \r\n\r\nAfter the war the fonds of the Department of Cinema, Photo and Phonographic documents of the State Central Archive of the October Revolution and Socialist Construction of Soviet Estonia were mostly closed to the public, in line with the ideological framework of the Soviet period. In 1971, the National Central Archive of Film, Photo and Phonographic Documents of Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic (FFFRKA) began operating work. \r\n\r\nIn connection with re-establishment of Estonian independence in 1991, the basics of the archive’s work changed considerably. The opening of formerly classified fonds had begun already in 1987. \r\n\r\nSince 1999 the Estonian Film Archive has been a structural unit of the National Archives of Estonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n","administrativeStructure":"Since 1999 the Estonian Film Archive has been a structural unit of the National Archive of Estonia. For information about the administrative structure of the Film Archive, see [here](https://www.ra.ee/kontakt/?department=filmiarhiiv).","records":"For an overview of the Film Archive's collection policies, see:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ra.ee/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Filmiarhiivi.tegevuspohimotted_vers.1.1_ENG.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","holdings":"The archival holdings are divided into 3 groups: film, photo and audio\r\n\r\n*Film collection*\r\n\r\nThe collections of the Film Archives include film and video material on Estonia from the early 20th century to the present. Organised acquisition of films started in 1935 on the basis of the Archives Act, and focused on newsreels. The earliest film footage dates back to 1908. The oldest domestic films were produced by Johannes Pääsuke between 1912 and 1914.\r\n\r\nThe Film Archives hold newsreels, newsreel segments, documentaries, music films, feature films, animated films, advertisements and amateur films. The archives are the repository for more than 8,000 titles of film and close to 7,000 original video titles. The collections also include outtakes from television programmes and films, fragments of films that have not survived in their entirety, and other additional materials such as film postproduction transcripts, screenplays and posters.\r\n\r\nThe archives have abundant audiovisual material related to cultural and sports events. The largest part of the film collection consists of newsreels, which offer a rich trove of material in the fields of genealogy, institutions, industry and agriculture. On military themes, there is unique footage from the Estonian War of Independence, the Defence League (Kaitseliit), the Defence Forces, and the Women’s Voluntary Defence Organisation (Naiskodukaitse).\r\n\r\nThe amateur films in the archives were shot by both cinematographers for whom it was a hobby and associations of amateur filmmakers connected to various institutions. The film archives have also acquired amateur films and video recordings documenting émigré Estonian activities abroad – for example, the Estonian Archives in Australia, the Consulate General of Estonia in New York City, the Swedish Estonian Society in Stockholm and the Boston Estonian Society collections.\r\n\r\nFrom the pre-World War II period, only a few titles of feature films  survive: ”Karujaht Pärnumaal” (Bear Hunt in Pärnu County, 1914), “Tšekaa komissar Miroštšenko” (Cheka Commissar Miroshchenko, 1925), “Noored kotkad” (Young Eagles, 1927), “Jüri Rumm” (1929), “Kire lained” (Waves of Passion, 1930), “Päikese lapsed” (Children of the Sun, 1932) and fragments of the films “Kevade unelm” (A Spring Dream, 1927) and “Vigased pruudid” (Defective Brides, 1929). The archives also are the depository for feature films produced by Tallinnfilm. After the Republic of Estonia regained independence, many private companies appeared on the film landscape, and up until early 2017, they had no obligation to hand their films over to the archives. As a result, the archives do not comprehensively represent the films produced in Estonia.\r\n\r\n*Photo collection*\r\n\r\nThe photo collection of the National Archives is Estonia’s largest collection of historical photographs. In January 2001, it was made up of almost 500,000 photo documents; 265 035 of which had been described and belong to 522 different fonds. The collection took shape as a result of the 1935 Archives Act and the Soviet-era archival system. The oldest photographs date from the late 19th century archives of persons and societies, including the portraits and albums of Baltic German families (zur Mühlen, Krusenstern, Ungern-Sternberg), student fraternities (Estonia, Livonia, Estonian Students’ Society) and the agriculture and genealogy societies (Estonian Agricultural Society of Tartu, Matriculation Commission of the Estonian Welfare Association, German Genealogical Society of Tartu). The National Archives’ oldest photograph – a daguerreotype from the late 1840s – and 12 ferrotypes are noteworthy rarities.\r\n\r\nThe archives contain collections based on photographers, collectors, individuals, companies, organisations, schools and institutions of state. The latter include police photos of criminals and fugitives, and photographs of weapons and driving licences. The largest part of the photo collections of the Film Archives consist of the collections of Estonian newspaper offices. Since the 1990s, the newspapers have preserved their collections inhouse, but in the Soviet era, the archives made periodic acquisitions from nearly all newspapers, particular collections of note were those of the ETA wire service (64,000 photographs), *Rahva Hääl* newspaper and *Spordileht*.\r\n\r\nThe archives also contain matter of interest to military buffs: personal archives of military figures, albums documenting World War I, the Defence League districts, the members of Estonian cabinets of ministers.\r\n\r\nPhotos from émigré Estonian organisations and personal archives describe how Estonians in the various countries lived: participation in the ESTO festivals, celebration of various anniversaries. The oldest photos depicting Estonians’ daily lives are from America, and the Far East and Russia.\r\n\r\nFilm-related photo collections include albums of screen tests for feature films and photos from the set for Tallinnfilm studio. Numerous photos of theatres in the Estonian SSR are also preserved here.\r\n\r\n*Audio collection*\r\n\r\nIn January 2001, the audio collection consisted of more than 7,000 items. A prominent part of the collection of sound recordings consists of phonograph records produced since  early 20th century, as well as of the radio broadcasts produced from the 1930s onwards. The first Estonian-language sound recording was produced in 1901 in St. Petersburg, but the oldest sound recordings in the Film Archives are one-sided gramophone discs released in 1904.\r\n\r\nThe earliest recordings of radio broadcasts – on now-rare acetate records – date from the second half of the 1930s. In government departments, the first phonograms were recorded in the mid-1970s and the acquisition of these in various formats continues today. In the first few years of the re-independence period, many film and record production institutions went defunct. As a result, the audio collection of the Film Archives increased with the acquisition of Tallinnfilm audio archives and master tapes for vinyl discs released by Meloodia company.\r\n\r\nOver the last decade, the share of material from Estonian diasporic communities has increased significantly. The most important personal archives are the audio collections of recording producer Viljar Nairis and the writer Enn Nõu. The most significant radio collections  consist of broadcasts by Eesti Raadio, Eesti Televisioon, Radio Free Europe, and the Stockholm Association of Estonian Music and Culture community radio. The latter collection also contains programming and recordings from other Estonian-language radio stations’ programming from Sweden and other places.\r\n\r\nThe sound recordings of performances by well-known persons constitute an invaluable part of the audio collections. These include both speeches by statesmen in the interwar era and by leaders of governments in exile. Also fascinating are speeches by significant figures in art, music, literature, science and sport. The main aim of the record collection is to preserve a maximum number of the records issued in, or related to, Estonia before World War II and later on.\r\n\r\n","openingTimes":"Monday to Thursday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.\r\n<br />Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.","conditions":"Researchers have free access to the archived items, provided the technical status of the latter allows for such use and that this use is not restricted under contractual relationships concerning private property.","researchServices":"A consultant is available in the reading room to assist researchers.

The inspiration for collecting came from one decoratively marbled Easter egg. The first exhibit was a Chinese opium pipe. \r\n\r\nIn 1822, Burchard put on the exhibition \"Antiquities and rarities\" at the House of the Brotherhood of the Blackheads. This event was the first of its kind in Tallinn.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, an academic society of Baltic Germans, the Estonian Literature Society (ELS, Estländische Literärische Gesellschaft), was founded in Tallinn, and one of its aims was to establish a museum “to broaden our knowledge of this country by studying its history, art, manufacturing, technology and nature”. Extensive collections were compiled over the following twenty years, which formed the basis of the Provincial Museum of the Estonian Literature Society, founded in 1864 at the house of St. Canute's Guild.\r\n\r\nIn 1911, the ELS purchased premises on Toompea at 6 Kohtu Street, where the museum's innovative activities could flourish. As the only museum in the city, it became an important focal point in Tallinn's cultural life with educational lectures and exhibitions.\r\n\r\nThe Estonian National Museum in Tartu, founded in 1909, became the most important museum in the Republic of Estonia (1918–1940), but the Museum of the ELS retained its important position through its valuable collections, with the archaeological, natural science and cultural history collections and archive continuing to thrive.\r\n\r\nMajor changes took place at the Museum of the ELS after Estonia was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940. The museum was nationalised and the History Museum of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic was established in its place. Some of the exhibits were transferred to other museums. The Estonian SSR Museum of Natural History was established using the collections of natural sciences. Overbearing ideological pressure ruined the museum in the following years. In addition to subjugating museum employees, items that were deemed harmful were eliminated, which meant destroying everything that reminded people of the Republic of Estonia. Still a majority of the main collections were preserved, some of which was saved thanks to the personal enthusiasm of the collection managers.\r\n\r\nThe museum moved to its current location at the Great Guild Hall in 1952.\r\n\r\nMaarjamäe Palace, where the History and Revolution Museum of the Estonian SSR was opened in 1987, was amalgamated with the museum in 1975.\r\n\r\nIn 1989, the museum was renamed the Estonian History Museum. Many important exhibitions that introduced the contemporary history of Estonia were held in the late 1980s and early 1990s: “Tricolour Estonia” at the Great Guild Hall (1989) and “Stalinism in Estonia” at Maarjamäe Palace (1990).\r\n","holdings":"The museum collection of the History Museum includes 12 collections, the earliest of which began in the mid-19th century with the collection of the museum of the Estonian Literature Society. \r\n\r\nThe oldest object in the collections of the Estonian History Museum is an Acheulean stone axe (dating back 1.5 million – 60 000 years ago) and the youngest object was used by someone only yesterday.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1860s, an archaeology collection was established in addition to the collections of documents, antiquities, seals, coins, art objects and natural sciences. The establishment of the Provincial Museum in 1864 was the first time when contemporary items were also collected, and displayed in public. The latter inspired people to bring an increasing amount of objects to the museum. In addition to donations, mainly from members of famous noble families of the time, and public figures, the collections were also supplemented by the acquisition of private collections. Tallinn’s town hall pharmacist Johann Burchard’s collection \"Mon Faible\", the collection of the academician Karl Ernst von Baer, and archaeological artefacts collected by history enthusiast Jaan Jung all ended up in the museum. 1875 saw the publication of the first catalogue of collections, compiled by G. J. von Hansen. The great value and scientific potential of the collections, archive and library of the Provincial Museum was also recognised by the Republic of Estonia.\r\n\r\nReforms implemented by the Soviet authorities during the 1940s–1960s significantly affected the museum collection as well. The collections of the Military Museum, Police Museum and some smaller museums were added to the History and Revolution Museum of the Estonian SSR. Materials of the Learned Estonian Society as well as items from the Postal Museum, Literature Museum and the Estonian National Museum were handed over to the museum. At the same time, the museum lost more than 200,000 objects. The Estonian SSR Museum of Natural History was established using the collections of natural sciences, and about 135,500 printed items became the core of the Baltica section of the Academic Library of Tallinn University. \r\n\r\nFrom the early 1990s, the collections were replenished by objects dating back to the time of the first Republic of Estonia, and materials on political history that had survived the Soviet period. With the creation of the Film Museum in 2006, the museum collection was supplemented with items from the history of Estonian film. In 2016, the collection of the Estonian Museum of Economy was added to the museum collection. \r\n","openingTimes":"Artefacts and archival collections, which can be viewed at the Maarjamäe History Centre (Pirita tee 56, Tallinn), are open for researchers from Monday to Friday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\r\n\r\nResearchers can search the card files and materials in the artefact and archival collections by appointment with a collection manager.

Since its beginning, the Institute has been housed in the pre-war building of the Main Judaic Library. The Library’s walls survived the fire caused by the Germans on May 16, 1943, as they were dynamiting the adjacent Great Synagogue. (The „Blue Tower” on Plac Bankowy now stands in the synagogue’s place.) Since 2009, the Jewish Historical Institute has the status of a state cultural institution serving as a research and documentation center. ","holdings":"The Jewish Historical Institute‘s Archives have the largest collection in Poland of documents concerning the history of Polish Jews in the 20th century. During the whole post-war period and until today, the JHI Archives have been supplementing their collection of testimonies and memoirs concerning the Holocaust. Today, the collection numbers 6967 testimonies and 346 memoirs. The Archives are still collecting, though now on a small scale, documents and testimonies referring to the history of the Jews in Poland.\r\nThe year 1944 can be considered the beginning of JHI Archives, when right after the end of the war, the Central Jewish Historical Commission was established in Lublin by the Central Committee of the Jews in Poland – the Jewish self-governing body. In 1945, the Commission headquarters was moved to Łódź, and branches were opened in few cities, among others in Kraków, Białystok, Warsaw, Katowice and Wrocław. One of the major aims of the Commission was documenting the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1949–1950, the JHI Archives accepted records of the dissolved post-war Jewish organizations, especially of the Central Committee of the Jews in Poland, but also of the Organization for the Development of Creativity (ORT), the Society for the Protection of Health (TOZ), various political parties and Zionist organizations (Ichud, Hanoar Ha-Tziyoni, Poalei Zion, Hitachdut, Keren Ha-Yesod) and of the Bund. Documentation also reached the Archives from foreign organizations that had branches in post-war Poland: the American Joint Distribution Committee and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. The above-mentioned archival units are very large and show in detail post-war Jewish life in Poland, together with the problems of emigration. Unique on a worldwide scale is the card catalogue — numbering nearly 300,000 records — of the Jews registered in Poland after the war.\r\n\r\nThe Underground Archive of the Warsaw Ghetto, the so-called Ringelblum Archive, listed on UNESCO ’s „Memory of the World” Register as a monument of world heritage, is a unique collection of documents that are one of the world’s most significant testimonies about the extermination of Polish Jewry. It was created in November 1940 at the initiative of historian Dr. Emanuel Ringelblum and with the involvement of the Oneg Shabbat (Joy of the Sabbath – because of their Saturday meetings) organization created by him. The group numbered several people and undertook the task of gathering and developing documentation — broadly defined — on the fate of Jews under the German occupation. The activity of the Oneg Shabbat was completely secret. The inhabitants of the ghetto did not know about it. As a cover for their activities Oneg Shabbat used the Jewish Social Self-Help (ŻSS), a social-service organization tolerated by the Nazis, but also leading considerable underground activity. The ŻSS office was located in the building of the Main Judaic Library, next to the Great Synagogue at Tłomackie St. That building since 1947 has been the Jewish Historical Institute headquarters and the storage site of the Ringelblum Archive.\r\n\r\nWhen, at the beginning of 1942, the first news of the mass murder of Jews reached Warsaw, the activity of Oneg Shabbat underwent reorientation. Instead of collecting materials for a broad monography on the life of Jewish people on the Polish soil, the group started documenting the destruction of further Jewish communities and relaying this information to the public. The organization maintained contact with the Polish resistance movement (including the Government Delegation for Poland) and provided it with copies of gathered documents. In 1942, through Polish and Jewish organizations, the Holocaust reports of Oneg Shabbat found their way to the West.\r\nFor further information see A.

It is recognized by decree and funded by the Flemish Community.\r\n\r\nThe ADVN is an archive and research centre that focuses on nationalism and national movements in general, and Flemish nationalism and the Flemish movement in particular. It collects, preserves and describes all sorts of historical sources related to these subjects (archives, books, periodicals, photographs, films, tapes a.s.o.). These are made available, general and specific regulations permitting, for research in its reading room. These sources are also used for publications, exhibitions and media purposes (newspapers, periodicals, television, radio). The institute carries out scientific research on all theoretical, general and specialised topics in the field of nationalism. It also partakes in a number of state-funded database projects, like ODIS (a database on Flemish intermediary structures: www.odis.be) and Archiefbank Vlaanderen (the archival database for private archives in Flanders: www.archiefbank.be). The ADVN publishes the results of its research through conferences, exhibitions and publications. It also produces *Wetenschappelijke tijdingen*, the leading scientific journal on the history of the Flemish movement.\r\n","holdings":"The core collection of the ADVN consists of archives and collections created by and from the national movements in Flanders in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries: Flemish nationalism, the cultural, political and socio-economic sections of the Flemish movement, and the historically related Greater and Whole Netherlands movements. The core collection contains material concerned with, for example, the earliest language struggles in the 19th century; the Front movement and activism; mass mobilization and radicalization in the interwar period; collaboration and repression; post-war party formation; state reforms; and institutionalisation since the 1970s. The collection therefore focuses on more than just the political aspects of nationalism; it also considers the cultural, social, economic and ecological aspects of national movements and national identity formation in Flanders.\r\n\r\nThe complementary collections of the ADVN are primarily made up of material originating from or created by various social projects and movements that have had historical links with the national movements in Flanders. As a result, the ADVN holds thematic sub-collections on federalism, pacifism, the Daensist movement and Flemish folk art, and four thematic sub-collections grouped in the radical/controversial cluster based on the themes of racism, negationism, fascism and right-wing radicalism.\r\n\r\nThe ADVN collection is spread over and is managed by three departments:\r\n \r\n- the archive department\r\n\r\n- the image & sound department\r\n\r\n- the library department\r\n\r\n**Archive**\r\nAll unpublished documents, both paper and digital, are stored in this department. Specifically, it concerns correspondence, reports, accounting, notes, diaries, personal notes, etc. These documents are described in transfer lists or inventories that can only be consulted internally. An overview of all archives is available online. As the collections held by the ADVN have differing access restrictions, requests view them are subject to a preliminary examination of the conditions for consultation.\r\n\r\n**Image & Sound**\r\nAll unpublished and published documents held by the Image & Sound department require specific storage according to their format or material origin. Specifically, the department is responsible for conserving films, video cassettes, photos, glass negatives, slides, sound cassettes, sound tapes, compact discs, floppy disks, gramophone records, posters, wall papers, prints, picture cards, license plates, stickers, plans and cards, paintings, drawings, menus, stamps, shields, banners, text signs, bas-reliefs, death masks, flags, banners and pennants, uniforms etc. These pieces are formally and substantively described in a database that can be consulted online at: https://advn.be/nl/zoeken\r\n\r\nThe published documents held by the Image & Sound department are, in principle, freely and immediately available for consultation. As with documents held by the Archives department, requests for unpublished material (e.g. photos and interviews) are subject to a preliminary examination of the conditions for consultation (response after a maximum of five days). The documents that have been digitised are, in principle, not removed from storage.\r\n\r\n**Library**\r\nAll published publications, both of paper and digital origin, are held by the Library. The Library’s collection includes books; brochures; newspapers; magazines; and other various forms of documentation (clippings, pamphlets and leaflets, music scores, prayer cards and obituaries). These publications are described in a database that can be consulted online.

The Mémorial de la Shoah Fondation and its Documentation Centre are the continuation and heirs of the Mémorial du Martyr Juif Inconnu and the Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine (1943-2013). Situated at this turning point of the « century of genocides », open to the new century, the new institution is intended as a bridge between the men and women who were contemporaries of the Shoah and those who did not experience this period of history, either directly or through the mediation of their parents.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is a continuation of the CDJC and the Memorial to the Unknown Jewish Martyr, the Shoah Memorial also represents a new phase in the transmission of the memory and the lessons of the Shoah, which so far had been essentially borne by the direct witnesses of the extermination of Jews of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Memorial de la Shoah Fondation is a resource centre, the first and foremost collection of archives on the Shoah in Europe, but it is also a \"museum of vigilance\", designed to learn, understand and experience, because now and forever it will always be necessary to build \"a rampart against oblivion, against a rekindling of hatred and contempt for man\", to quote its President Eric de Rothschild.","holdings":"The archives of the CDJC include archival collections totaling more than thirty million documents, including many originals bearing the signature of the heads of the Third Reich and those responsible for the deportation of the Jews from France. The CDJC's main archive collections are:\r\n\r\n**A - German sources** \r\n\r\n*The headquarters in France, Militärbefehlshaber in Frankreich (MBF)* \r\n<br />The MBF, or German military administration in France, was divided into two major sections: the military command and the administrative command. The archives of the military command cover collaboration between the occupation authorities and the Pétain government in general, the persecution of the Jews and the general reprisal policy. The archives of the administrative command include the documents dealing with the control of the occupation authorities over the French economy (interference, spoliations, in particular economic aryanization). The German Embassy in Paris was very actively involved in the anti-Jewish measures as can be attested by the numerous telegrams and letters sent several times per day to Berlin by Abetz and Schleier (Plenipotentiary Minister at the German embassy in Paris). \r\n\r\n*The Gestapo in occupied France* \r\n<br />The records of the Anti-Jewish division of the Gestapo in Paris include letters, telegrams, and reports on internments, deportations and other measures taken against the Jews, such as wearing the yellow star, rescinding naturalisation and general reprisals. There are also documents showing the pressure exerted on Italy's policy in the Italian occupied zone.This group also contains documents on the Gestapo in France preserved in the German federal archives (Bundesarchiv Koblenz). These records give us a true picture of the structures and the activity of the Gestapo in France and in particular the anti-Jewish division, first directed by Dannecker then by Rothke. \r\n\r\n*The archives of the Nuremberg trials*\r\n<br />This contains a part of the documentation collected for the investigations of the international military trials as well as the trials conducted by the American military court. A specific classification system is used here for this major group of archives. The main subdivisions are as follows:\r\n<br />NO (Nazi Organization): this reference includes the documents from any Nazi organization, in particular those relating to the role of the S.S., and the WVHA (Central Office of the Economy and the Administration of the S.S.). \r\n<br />NOKW (Nazi \" Oberkommando der Wehrmacht \"): this group of documents deals with the activities of the German army.\r\n<br />NG (Nazi Government): documents illustrating the activity of the State bodies related to those of the Party. \r\n<br />NI (Nazi Industry): documents related to industry and the financial institutions of the Third Reich.\r\n\r\n**B - French sources** \r\n\r\n*Archives of the General Commission on Jewish Affairs*\r\n<br />The CDJC has more than 20,000 documents from the CGQJ as well as the deliberations of the trials of its leaders.\r\n\r\n*The archives of Professor Montandon*\r\n<br/>Montandon was an ethnologist and \"expert on racial issues\" with the CGQJ. This partial archive group covers the period from 1924 to 1944 and deals first with his scientific ethnology work then with his activities in anti-Jewish propaganda from 1938. \r\n\r\n*Institut d'Etude des Questions Juives*\r\n<br />The CDJC has kept the major portion of the documents of this body created in 1941 at the instigation of Dannecker. The collection includes the correspondence of the Secretary General and describes all the activities of the Institute.\r\n\r\n*Other archive groups* \r\n<BR />The archives of the CDJC contain many other documents from the Service of the Armistice, the Prefecture of the Police but also Jewish organizations such as: l'Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants (O.S.E.), les Eclaireurs Israélites de France (E.I.F.) la Fédération des Sociétés Juives de France (F.S.J.F.), Le Conseil Représentatif des Institutions Juives de France (C.R.I.F.), l'Oeuvre de Protection de L'Enfance Juive (O.P.E.J.), la Commission Centrale de l'Enfance (C.C.E.), the ORT in France.\r\n\r\n**C.
